FOR the purpose of ~~establishing~~ ~~the~~ ~~21st~~ ~~Century~~ ~~Financial~~ ~~Systems~~ ~~Council~~ ~~to~~ ~~modernize~~
~~the~~ ~~financial~~ ~~management~~ ~~information~~ ~~systems~~ ~~infrastructure~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~State;~~
~~specifying~~ ~~the~~ ~~responsibilities~~ ~~and~~ ~~priorities~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~Council;~~ ~~establishing~~ ~~the~~ ~~position~~
~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~21st~~ ~~Century~~ ~~Financial~~ ~~Systems~~ ~~Director~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~Office~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~Comptroller;~~ ~~and~~

BY adding to
Article – State Government
Section 4–113
Annotated Code of Maryland
(2021 Replacement Volume and 2022 Supplement)

Preamble

WHEREAS, Substantial risk and waste are generated from the continued use of the
State’s existing accounting and payments platform, the Financial Management and
Information System (FMIS), due to limited development resources, cybersecurity risks, and
difficulties delivering functional enhancements to meet evolving end–user needs and
legislative mandates; and

WHEREAS, The State must consider how future systems will integrate across the
State’s broader ecosystem and understand that there is substantial risk if key finance
functions remain fractured in multiple systems; and

WHEREAS, The State’s financial systems and applications are operated and
maintained by different departments, which contributes to a complex information
technology ecosystem and governance challenges; and

WHEREAS, The Office of the Comptroller, as the chief financial officer of the State,
should lead the effort to consolidate and modernize the financial systems under a single

Ch. 23 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

21st Century Financial Systems Enterprise that shall become the State’s financial system
of record; and

WHEREAS, The Office of the Comptroller should partner with the Office of the State
Treasurer, the Department of Budget and Management, the Department of Information
Technology, and the Department of General Services to consolidate and modernize the
financial systems under a single 21st Century Financial Systems Enterprise; and

WHEREAS, Because the Modernize Maryland Oversight Commission is responsible
for a substantial amount of the State’s information technology and cybersecurity
collaboration, input and participation by that body and the constituent agencies it supports
will be essential to the creation of the 21st Century Financial Systems Enterprise; and

WHEREAS, Because the State has multiple information technology modernization
initiatives currently underway that may impact the implementation of a new financial
management and payroll system, a coordinated strategy and strong legislative directive is
required to minimize additional information technology complexities, technical debt,
process inefficiency, and overall cost; now, therefore,
