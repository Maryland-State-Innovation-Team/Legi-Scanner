~~services~~ ~~providers.~~ funding provided
under the federal Victims of Crime Act
(VOCA) and additional State funding
provided through the Governor’s Office
of Crime Prevention, Youth, and
Victim Services (GOCPYVS) for fiscal
2024 shall be awarded in the following
manner: (1) $49,100,000 awarded for a
9–month period from October 1, 2023,
to June 30, 2024, prorated to reflect a
9–month award, to victim services
providers who received funding during
fiscal 2023 at a prorated amount equal
to no less than the same level as fiscal
2023 to continue services to victims of
crime during fiscal 2024, provided that
all services proposed by the victim
services provider are allowable under
federal VOCA regulations. No federal
or State funding may be awarded to
additional victim services providers,
State agencies, programs, or held in
reserve until this amount is distributed
in this prescribed manner. For the
purposes of identifying a State agency
or program, it is the intent of the
budget committees that higher
education institutions, the Baltimore
Police Department, and other
quasi–State entities be excluded from
that definition and be included in the
category of non–State victim services
providers; and (2) any remaining
funds shall be awarded to existing or
new grantees on a competitive basis.

Further provided that if funding under the
VOCA is reduced, funding shall be awarded
in the following manner:

(1) victim services providers who
received funding during fiscal 2023
shall receive all available VOCA
funds, and funding for each
provider may only be reduced by the
same percentage as other providers,

– 21 –

PAGE 22
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

unless a provider submits a grant
request for a lower amount; and

(2) in the event that funding is not
available, each grant shall be
reduced by the same percentage
unless a provider has requested
reduced funding. Non–State
providers shall be fully funded prior
to any award to a State agency and
prior to the retention of reserve
funds. If additional State or federal
funding becomes available, such
cuts shall be restored.

~~No~~ ~~VOCA~~ ~~funding~~ ~~may~~ ~~be~~ ~~awarded~~ ~~by~~
~~GOCPYVS~~ ~~except~~ ~~in~~ ~~a~~ ~~manner~~ ~~that~~ ~~gives~~
~~priority~~ ~~to~~ ~~continuing~~ ~~funding~~ ~~for~~
~~non–State~~ ~~victim~~ ~~services~~ ~~providers~~ ~~who~~
~~received~~ ~~funding~~ ~~during~~ ~~fiscal~~ ~~2022,~~ ~~have~~
~~the~~ ~~capacity~~ ~~to~~ ~~continue~~ ~~to~~ ~~provide~~ ~~services~~
~~to~~ ~~victims,~~ ~~and~~ ~~have~~ ~~submitted~~ ~~an~~
~~application~~ ~~for~~ ~~services~~ ~~that~~ ~~are~~ ~~allowable~~
~~under~~ ~~federal~~ ~~VOCA~~ ~~regulations.~~

Further provided that $500,000 of the general
fund appropriation for GOCPYVS made for
the purposes of general administration may
not be expended until, prior to providing
fiscal 2024 awards and no later than
August 1, 2023, GOCPYVS reports to the
budget committees on:

each proposed grant award,(1)
including those that will be
competitively–awarded;

(2) how priority has been given to
non–State victim services providers;

(3) whether each
continuation–eligible grant is
equal to fiscal 2023 awards; and, if
it is not, the identification of the
difference in funding and
justification for this difference; and

– 22 –

(4) the amount of VOCA funding held
in reserve.

In addition to the official report, data shall be
provided in an electronic format subject to
the concurrence of the Department of
Legislative Services (DLS). The budget
committees shall have 45 days from the date
of the receipt of the report to review and
comment. Funds not expended for this
restricted purpose may not be transferred by
budget amendment or otherwise to any
other purpose and shall revert to the
General Fund if the report is not submitted.

Further provided that $500,000 of the general
fund appropriation for the purposes of
administration may not be expended until
GOCPYVS submits a report by November 1,
2023, regarding the federal VOCA funding.
The report shall include:

(1) total active VOCA grant awards as
of January 1, 2023, including grant
number, implementing agency,
project title, start date, end date,
amount of award, jurisdiction of
implementation, and the brief
description/abstract of the grant;

(2) for each VOCA grant award in item
(1) and for any other VOCA grant
awards made subsequently, a
description of whether for the
federal fiscal year beginning
October 1, 2023, the award was
continued, competitively awarded,
or otherwise funded, including the
grant number, implementing
agency, project title, start date, end
date, amount of award, jurisdiction
of implementation, and the brief
description/abstract of the grant;

(3) for each VOCA grant award in

items (1) and (2), identification of
any decrease or other change in
victim services funding between
items (1) and (2), the justification
for each grant award change, and
the impact on the continuity of crime
victim services;

(4) the amount of unexpended funds for
each open 3–year VOCA grant and
the reason funds are unexpended,
including whether they are held in
reserve for future grants;

(5) identification of the respective
amount of funds expended for the
purpose of direct provision of
services, administration, and that
which went unobligated for the
federal fiscal 2019 and 2020
3–year funding cycles;

(6) comparison of aggregate–level
performance measures or outcome
measures of the State’s VOCA
program for fiscal 2017 through
2023 or as many recent years that
GOCPYVS is able to provide;

(7) identification of the legislative
appropriation for VOCA and the
actual level of spending for each
State fiscal year, beginning with
State fiscal 2016 through 2023; and

(8) identification of any decrease or
other change between the legislative
appropriation for VOCA and the
actual level of spending for VOCA
for each State fiscal year identified
in item (7), and the reason for any
and all disparities that may exist
between the legislative
appropriation and the actual
spending level.

COMPTROLLER OF MARYLAND

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER

Provided that the Comptroller of
Maryland shall conduct a study on
fines, penalties, and interest rates
charged by the Comptroller’s Office
and submit the findings to the budget
committees no later than October 20,
2023. The study should specifically
explore the concern of varying rates
paid by the Comptroller’s Office when
a refund is due to a taxpayer as a result
of an error made by the Office versus
the rates paid by a taxpayer to the
Office when the taxpayer makes an
error or fails to pay tax obligations in
a timely manner. The submitted report
should specifically identify an
equitable or fair rate that balances the
competing interests.

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Provided that it is the intent of the General
Assembly that projects and funding levels
appropriated for capital projects, as well as
total estimated project costs within the
Consolidated Transportation Program,
shall be expended in accordance with the
plan approved during the legislative
session. The department shall prepare a
report to notify the budget committees of
the proposed changes in the event that the
department modifies the program to:

(1) add a new project to the
construction program or
development and evaluation
program meeting the definition of a
“major project” under Section
2–103.1 of the Transportation
Article that was not previously
contained within a plan reviewed in
a prior year by the General
Assembly and will result in the
need to expend funds in the current
budget year; or

(2) change the scope of a project in the
construction program or
development and evaluation
program meeting the definition of a
“major project” under Section
2–103.1 of the Transportation
Article that will result in an
increase of more than 10% or
$1,000,000, whichever is greater, in
the total project costs as reviewed
by the General Assembly during a
prior session.

For each change, the report shall identify the
project title, justification for adding the
new project or modifying the scope of the
existing project, current year funding
levels, and the total project cost as
approved by the General Assembly during

– 61 –

PAGE 62
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

the prior session compared with the
proposed current year funding and total
project cost estimate resulting from the
project addition or change in scope.

Further provided that notification of project
additions, as outlined in paragraph (1)
above; changes in the scope of a project, as
outlined in paragraph (2) above; or moving
projects from the development and
evaluation program to the construction
program shall be made to the General
Assembly 45 days prior to the expenditure
of funds or the submission of any contract
for approval to the Board of Public Works.

The Maryland Department of Transportation
(MDOT) may not expend funds on any job
or position of employment approved in this
budget in excess of 9,120.5 positions and
115.0 contractual full–time equivalent
(FTE) positions paid through special
payments payroll (defined as the quotient
of the sum of the hours worked by all such
employees in the fiscal year divided by
2,080 hours) of the total authorized amount
established in the budget for MDOT at any
one time during fiscal 2024. The level of
contractual FTE positions may be exceeded
only if MDOT notifies the budget
committees of the need and justification for
additional contractual personnel due to:

(1) business growth at the Helen
Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore
or Baltimore/Washington
International Thurgood Marshall
Airport that demands additional
personnel; or

(2) emergency needs that must be met,
such as transit security or highway
maintenance.

The Secretary shall use the authority under
Sections 2–101 and 2–102 of the

– 62 –

PAGE 63
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 101

Transportation Article to implement this
provision. However, any authorized job or
position to be filled above the regular
position ceiling approved by the Board of
Public Works shall count against the Rule
of 100 imposed by the General Assembly.
The establishment of new jobs or positions
of employment not authorized in the fiscal
2024 budget shall be subject to Section
7–236 of the State Finance and
Procurement Article and the Rule of 100.

Further provided that a nonpublic school
participating in the Aid to Non–Public
Schools Program R00A03.04 shall certify
compliance with Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the
State Government Article. A nonpublic
school participating in the program may
not discriminate in student admissions,
retention, or expulsion, or otherwise
discriminate against any student on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sexual
orientation, or gender identity or
expression. Nothing herein shall require
any school or institution to adopt any rule,
regulation, or policy that conflicts with its
religious or moral teachings. However, all
participating schools must agree that they
will not discriminate in student
admissions, retention, or expulsion or
otherwise discriminate against any
student on the basis of race, color, national
origin, sexual orientation, or gender
identity or expression. Any school found to
be in violation of the requirements to not
discriminate shall be required to return to
the Maryland State Department of
Education all textbooks or computer
hardware and software and other
electronically delivered learning materials
acquired through the fiscal 2023 allocation.
The only other legal remedy for violation of
these provisions is ineligibility for
participating in the Aid to Non–Public
Schools Program. Any school that is found
in violation of the nondiscrimination
requirements in fiscal 2023 or 2024 may

– 163 –

Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

not participate in the program in fiscal
2024. It is the intent of the General
Assembly that a school that violates the
nondiscrimination requirements is
ineligible to participate in the Aid to
Non–Public Schools Program, the
Broadening Options and Opportunities for
Students Today Program, the James E.
“Ed” DeGrange Nonpublic Aging Schools
Program, and the Nonpublic School
Security Improvements Program in the

gender identity or
expression. Nothing herein
shall require any school or
institution to adopt any rule,
regulation, or policy that
conflicts with its religious or
moral teachings. However,
all participating schools
must agree that they will not
discriminate in student
admissions, retention, or
expulsion or otherwise
discriminate against any
student based on race, color,
national origin, sexual
orientation, or gender
identity or expression. If a
nonpublic school does not
comply with these
requirements, it shall
reimburse MSDE all
scholarship funds received
under the BOOST Program
for the 2023–2024 school
year and may not charge the
student tuition and fees
instead. The only other legal
remedy for violation of this
provision is ineligibility for
participating in the BOOST
Program.

(2) MSDE shall establish procedures
for the application and award
process for scholarships for
students who are eligible for the
free or reduced–price lunch
program. The procedures shall
include consideration for award
adjustments if an eligible student
becomes ineligible during the
course of the school year. The
BOOST Advisory Board shall
prioritize awards for current
BOOST recipients and their
siblings and a student shall

(3) MSDE shall compile and certify a
list of applicants that ranks eligible
students by family income
expressed as a percent of the most
recent federal poverty levels.

(4) MSDE shall submit the ranked list
of applicants to the BOOST
Advisory Board.

(5) There is a BOOST Advisory Board
that shall be appointed as follows: 2
members appointed by the
Governor, 2 members appointed by
the President of the Senate, 2
members appointed by the Speaker
of the House of Delegates, and 1

Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
review and certify the ranked list of
applicants and shall determine the
scholarship award amounts. The
BOOST Advisory Board shall take
into account the needs of students
with disabilities on an
Individualized Education Plan or
504 Plan when determining
scholarship award amounts.

(7) MSDE shall make scholarship
awards to eligible students as
determined by the BOOST Advisory
Board.

(8) ~~The~~ Unless the student has special
needs due to a disability, the
amount of a scholarship award may
not exceed the lesser of:

(a) the statewide average per
pupil expenditure by local
education agencies, as
calculated by MSDE; or

(b) the tuition of the nonpublic
school.

(9) In order to meet its BOOST
Program reporting requirements to
the budget committees, MSDE shall
specify a date by which
participating nonpublic schools
must submit information to MSDE
so that it may complete its required
report. Any nonpublic schools that
do not provide the necessary
information by that specified date
shall be ineligible to participate in
the BOOST Program.

(10) Students who received a BOOST
Program scholarship award in the
prior year who still meet eligibility

priority shall be given to students
who attended public schools in the
prior school year.

Further provided that the BOOST Advisory
Board shall make all scholarship awards no
later than December 31, 2023, for the
2023–2024 school year to eligible
individuals. Any unexpended funds not
awarded to students for scholarships shall
be encumbered at the end of fiscal 2024 and
available for scholarships in the 2024–2025
school year.

Further provided that $700,000 of this
appropriation shall be used only to provide
an additional award for each student with
special needs that is at least equal in
amount to the BOOST Program
scholarship award that a student is
awarded in accordance with paragraph (6)
above.

Further provided that MSDE shall submit a
report to the budget committees by
January 15, 2024, that includes the
following:

SECTION 22. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That $100,000 of the general fund
appropriation made for the purpose of administrative expenses in D21A02.01 Governor’s
Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services’ Children and Youth Division
(CYD), $100,000 of the general fund appropriation of the Department of Human Services
Social Services Administration, $100,000 of the general fund appropriation of the
Department of Juvenile Services, $100,000 of the general fund appropriation of the
Maryland Department of Health Developmental Disabilities Administration, and $100,000
of the general fund appropriation of the Maryland State Department of Education may not
be expended until CYD submits a report on behalf of the Children’s Cabinet to the budget
committees on out–of–home placements containing:

(1) the total number and one–day counts (as of January 1) of out–of–home
placements and entries by jurisdiction, by agency, and by placement type for fiscal 2021,
2022, and 2023;

(2) the total number and one–day counts (as of January 1) of out–of–state
placements, including the number of family home, community–based, and
noncommunity–based out–of–state placements for fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023 categorized
by state and by age category;

(3) the costs associated with out–of–home placements;

(4) an explanation of recent placement trends;

(5) findings of child abuse and neglect occurring while families are

(6) areas of concern related to trends in out–of–home and/or out–of–state
placements and potential corrective actions that the Children’s Cabinet and local
management boards can take to address these concerns.

Further provided that each agency or administration that funds or places children
and youth in out–of–home placements shall assist CYD and comply with any data requests
necessary for the timely production of the report. The report shall be submitted to the
budget committees by January 1, 2024, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from
the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds not expended for this
restricted purpose may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise for any other
purpose. Should the report not be submitted by the requested date, the restricted funds
shall revert to the General Fund.

SECTION 23. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Governor’s budget books
shall include a forecast of the impact of the executive budget proposal on the long–term
fiscal condition of the General Fund, the Transportation Trust Fund, the Blueprint for
Maryland’s Future Fund, and higher education Current Unrestricted Fund accounts. This
forecast shall estimate aggregate revenues, expenditures, and fund balances in each
account for the fiscal year last completed, the current year, the budget year, and 4 years

– 311 –

PAGE 312
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

thereafter. Expenditures shall be reported at such agency, program or unit levels, or
categories as may be determined appropriate after consultation with the Department of
Legislative Services. A statement of major assumptions underlying the forecast shall also
be provided, including but not limited to general salary increases, inflation, and growth of
caseloads in significant program areas.

SECTION 24. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That all across–the–board
reductions applied to the Executive Branch, unless otherwise stated, shall apply to current
unrestricted and general funds in the University System of Maryland, St. Mary’s College
of Maryland, Morgan State University, and Baltimore City Community College.

SECTION 25. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Governor’s budget books
shall include a summary statement of federal revenues by major federal program sources
supporting the federal appropriations made therein along with the major assumptions
underpinning the federal fund estimates. The Department of Budget and Management
(DBM) shall exercise due diligence in reporting this data and ensure that they are updated
as appropriate to reflect ongoing congressional action on the federal budget. In addition,
DBM shall provide to the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) data for the actual,
current, and budget years listing the components of each federal fund appropriation by
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number or equivalent detail for programs not in
the catalog. Data shall be provided in an electronic format subject to the concurrence of
DLS.

SECTION 26. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That in the expenditure of federal
funds appropriated in this budget or subsequent to the enactment of this budget by the
budget amendment process:

(1) State agencies shall administer these federal funds in a manner that
recognizes that federal funds are taxpayer dollars that require prudent fiscal management,
careful application to the purposes for which they are directed, and strict attention to
budgetary and accounting procedures established for the administration of all public funds.

(2) For fiscal 2024, except with respect to capital appropriations, to the
extent consistent with federal requirements:

(a) when expenditures or encumbrances may be charged to either
State or federal fund sources, federal funds shall be charged before State funds are charged
except that this policy does not apply to the Department of Human Services with respect to
federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds to be carried forward into future
years;

(b) when additional federal funds are sought or otherwise become
available in the course of the fiscal year, agencies shall consider, in consultation with the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM), whether opportunities exist to use these
federal revenues to support existing operations rather than to expand programs or
establish new ones; and

– 312 –

PAGE 313
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 101

(c) DBM shall take appropriate actions to effectively establish the
provisions of this section as policies of the State with respect to the administration of
federal funds by executive agencies.

SECTION 27. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That it is the intent of the General
Assembly that all State departments, agencies, bureaus, commissions, boards, and other
organizational units included in the State budget, including the Judiciary, shall prepare
and submit items for the fiscal 2025 budget detailed by Comptroller subobject classification
in accordance with instructions promulgated by the Comptroller of Maryland. The
presentation of budget data in the Governor’s budget books shall include object, fund, and
personnel data in the manner provided for in fiscal 2024 except as indicated elsewhere in
this Act; however, this may not preclude the placement of additional information into the
budget books. For actual fiscal 2023 spending, the fiscal 2024 working appropriation, and
the fiscal 2025 allowance, the budget detail shall be available from the Department of
Budget and Management (DBM) automated data system at the subobject level by subobject
codes and classifications for all agencies. To the extent possible, except for public higher
education institutions, subobject expenditures shall be designated by fund for actual fiscal
2023 spending, the fiscal 2024 working appropriation, and the fiscal 2025 allowance. The
agencies shall exercise due diligence in reporting this data and ensuring correspondence
between reported position and expenditure data for the actual, current, and budget fiscal
years. This data shall be made available on request and in a format subject to the
concurrence of the Department of Legislative Services (DLS). Further, the expenditure of
appropriations shall be reported and accounted for by the subobject classification in
accordance with the instructions promulgated by the Comptroller of Maryland.

Further provided that due diligence shall be taken to accurately report full–time
equivalent (FTE) counts of contractual FTEs in the budget books. For the purpose of this
count, contractual FTEs are defined as those individuals having an employee–employer
relationship with the State. This count shall include those individuals in higher education
institutions who meet this definition but are paid with additional assistance funds.

Further provided that DBM shall provide to DLS with the allowance for each
department, unit, agency, office, and institution, a one–page organizational chart in
Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format that depicts the allocation of personnel across
operational and administrative activities of the entity.

Further provided that for each across–the–board reduction to appropriations or
positions in the fiscal 2025 Budget Bill affecting fiscal 2024 or 2025, DBM shall allocate the
reduction for each agency in a level of detail not less than the three–digit R*Stars financial
agency code and by each fund type.

Further provided that DBM shall provide to DLS special and federal fund accounting
detail for the fiscal year last completed, current year, and budget year for each fund. The
account detail, to be submitted with the allowance, should at a minimum provide revenue
and expenditure detail, along with starting and ending balances.

– 313 –

PAGE 314
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

Further provided that DBM shall provide to DLS by September 1, 2023, a list of
subprograms used by each department, unit, agency, office, and institution, along with a
brief description of the subprograms’ purpose and responsibilities.

SECTION 28. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That on or before August 1, 2023,
each State agency and each public institution of higher education shall report to the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) any agreements in place for any part of
fiscal 2023 between State agencies and any public institution of higher education involving
potential expenditures in excess of $100,000 over the term of the agreement. Further
provided that DBM shall provide direction and guidance to all State agencies and public
institutions of higher education as to the procedures and specific elements of data to be
reported with respect to these interagency agreements, to include at a minimum:

(1) a common code for each interagency agreement that specifically
identifies each agreement and the fiscal year in which the agreement began;

(2) the starting date for each agreement;

(3) the ending date for each agreement;

(4) a total potential expenditure, or not–to–exceed dollar amount, for the
services to be rendered over the term of the agreement by any public institution of higher
education to any State agency;

(5) a description of the nature of the goods and services to be provided;

(6) the total number of personnel, both full– and part–time, associated with
the agreement;

(7) contact information for the agency and the public institution of higher
education for the person(s) having direct oversight or knowledge of the agreement;

(8) total indirect cost recovery or facilities and administrative (F&A)
expenditures authorized for the agreement;

(9) the indirect cost recovery or F&A rate for the agreement and brief
description of how the rate was determined;

(10) actual expenditures for the most recently closed fiscal year;

(11) actual base expenditures that the indirect cost recovery or F&A rate
may be applied against during the most recently closed fiscal year;

(12) actual expenditures for indirect cost recovery or F&A for the most
recently closed fiscal year; and

PAGE 315
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 101

(13) total authorized expenditures for any subaward(s) or subcontract(s)
being used as part of the agreement and a brief description of the type of award or contract.

Further provided that DBM shall submit a consolidated report to the budget
committees and the Department of Legislative Services by December 1, 2023, that contains
information on all agreements between State agencies and any public institution of higher
education involving potential expenditures in excess of $100,000 that were in effect at any
time during fiscal 2023.

Further provided that no new higher education interagency agreement with State
agencies with a projected value in excess of $500,000 may be entered into during fiscal 2024
without prior approval of the Secretary of Budget and Management.

SECTION 29. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any budget amendment to
increase the total amount of special, federal, or higher education (current restricted and
current unrestricted) fund appropriations, or to make reimbursable fund transfers from the
Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services or the Maryland
Department of Emergency Management made in Section 1 of this Act shall be subject to
the following restrictions:

(1) This section may not apply to budget amendments for the sole purpose
of:

(a) appropriating funds available as a result of the award of federal
disaster assistance; and

(b) transferring funds from the State Reserve Fund – Economic
Development Opportunities Account for projects approved by the Legislative Policy
Committee (LPC).

(2) Budget amendments increasing total appropriations in any fund
account by $100,000 or more may not be approved by the Governor until:

(a) that amendment has been submitted to the Department of
Legislative Services (DLS); and

(b) the budget committees or LPC has considered the amendment or
45 days have elapsed from the date of submission of the amendment. Each amendment
submitted to DLS shall include a statement of the amount, sources of funds and purposes
of the amendment, and a summary of the impact on regular position or contractual
full–time equivalent payroll requirements.

(3) Unless permitted by the budget bill or the accompanying supporting
documentation or by any other authorizing legislation, and notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 3–216 of the Transportation Article, a budget amendment may not:

– 315 –

PAGE 316
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(a) restore funds for items or purposes specifically denied by the
General Assembly;

(b) fund a capital project not authorized by the General Assembly
provided, however, that subject to provisions of the Transportation Article, projects of the
Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) shall be restricted as provided in Section
1 of this Act;

(c) increase the scope of a capital project by an amount 7.5% or more
over the approved estimate or 5.0% or more over the net square footage of the approved
project until the amendment has been submitted to DLS, and the budget committees have
considered and offered comment to the Governor, or 45 days have elapsed from the date of
submission of the amendment. This provision does not apply to MDOT; and

(d) provide for the additional appropriation of special, federal, or
higher education funds of more than $100,000 for the reclassification of a position or
positions.

(4) A budget may not be amended to increase a federal fund appropriation
by $100,000 or more unless documentation evidencing the increase in funds is provided
with the amendment and fund availability is certified by the Secretary of Budget and
Management.

(5) No expenditure or contractual obligation of funds authorized by a
proposed budget amendment may be made prior to approval of that amendment by the
Governor.

(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any federal, special, or
higher education fund appropriation may be increased by budget amendment upon a
declaration by the Board of Public Works that the amendment is essential to maintaining
public safety, health, or welfare, including protecting the environment or the economic
welfare of the State.

(7) Budget amendments for new major information technology projects, as
defined by Sections 3A–301 and 3A–302 of the State Finance and Procurement Article,
must include an Information Technology Project Request, as defined in Section 3A–308 of
the State Finance and Procurement Article.

(8) Further provided that the fiscal 2024 appropriation detail as shown in
the Governor’s budget books submitted to the General Assembly in January 2024 and the
supporting electronic detail may not include appropriations for budget amendments that
have not been signed by the Governor, exclusive of the MDOT pay–as–you–go capital

(9) Further provided that it is the policy of the State to recognize and

– 316 –

PAGE 317
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 101

appropriate additional special, higher education, and federal revenues in the budget bill as
approved by the General Assembly. Further provided that for the fiscal 2024 allowance, the
Department of Budget and Management shall continue policies and procedures to minimize
reliance on budget amendments for appropriations that could be included in a deficiency
appropriation.

SECTION 30. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:

(1) The Secretary of Health shall maintain the accounting systems
necessary to determine the extent to which funds appropriated for fiscal 2023 in program
M00Q01.03 Medical Care Provider Reimbursements and M00Q01.10 Medicaid Behavioral
Health Provider Reimbursements have been disbursed for services provided in that fiscal
year and shall prepare and submit the monthly reports by fund type required under this
section for that program.

(2) The State Superintendent of Schools shall maintain the accounting
systems necessary to determine the extent to which funds appropriated for fiscal 2023 to
program R00A02.07 Students With Disabilities for nonpublic placements have been
disbursed for services provided in that fiscal year and to prepare monthly reports as
required under this section for that program.

(3) The Secretary of Human Services shall maintain the accounting
systems necessary to determine the extent to which funds appropriated for fiscal 2023 in
program N00G00.01 Foster Care Maintenance Payments have been disbursed for services
provided in that fiscal year, including detail by placement type for the average monthly
caseload, average monthly cost per case, and the total expended for each foster care
program, and to prepare the monthly reports required under this section for that program.

(4) For the programs specified, reports must indicate by fund type total
appropriations for fiscal 2023 and total disbursements for services provided during that
fiscal year up through the last day of the second month preceding the date on which the
report is to be submitted and a comparison to data applicable to those periods in the
preceding fiscal year.

(5) Reports shall be submitted to the budget committees, the Department
of Legislative Services, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Comptroller
beginning August 15, 2023, and submitted on a monthly basis thereafter.

(6) It is the intent of the General Assembly that general funds appropriated
for fiscal 2023 to the programs specified that have not been disbursed within a reasonable
period, not to exceed 12 months from the end of the fiscal year, shall revert.

SECTION 31. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, as the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act each make billions of dollars of
federal grant funds available to states and other entities on a competitive basis, it is the
intent of the General Assembly that State agencies aggressively pursue funding

– 317 –

PAGE 318
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

opportunities that align with the goals of the State. The General Assembly notes that many
of the grant opportunities require the commitment of State matching funds and asks that
agencies notify the budget committees at least 10 days prior to submitting the application
if the receipt of the grant will require the allocation of additional State resources to the
agency in fiscal 2024 or future years. The submission should include a brief description of
the opportunity, the amount of federal funds the State is seeking, and the required State
match.

Further provided that on a quarterly basis beginning July 1, 2023, the committees
request a report from the Department of Budget and Management summarizing all of the
competitive grants the State has applied for, the status of the application, and any state
match that is required by the grant.

SECTION 32. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That no position identification
number assigned to a position abolished in this budget may be reassigned to a job or
function different from that to which it was assigned when the budget was submitted to the
General Assembly. Incumbents in positions abolished may continue State employment in
another position.

SECTION 33. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Accounting
Division of the Comptroller of Maryland shall establish a subsidiary ledger control account
to debit all State agency funds budgeted under subobject 0175 (Workers’ Compensation)
and to credit all payments disbursed to the Injured Workers’ Insurance Fund (IWIF) via
transmittal. The control account shall also record all funds withdrawn from IWIF and
returned to the State and subsequently transferred to the General Fund. IWIF shall submit
monthly reports to the Department of Legislative Services concerning the status of the
account.

SECTION 34. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Board of Public Works
(BPW), in exercising its authority to create additional positions pursuant to Section 7–236
of the State Finance and Procurement Article, may authorize during the fiscal year no more
than 100 positions in excess of the total number of authorized State positions on July 1,
2023, as determined by the Secretary of Budget and Management. Provided, however, that
if the imposition of this ceiling causes undue hardship in any department, agency, board,
or commission, additional positions may be created for that affected unit to the extent that
an equal number of positions authorized by the General Assembly for the fiscal year are
abolished in that unit or in other units of State government. It is further provided that the
limit of 100 does not apply to any position that may be created in conformance with specific
manpower statutes that may be enacted by the State or federal government nor to any
positions created to implement block grant actions or to implement a program reflecting
fundamental changes in federal/State relationships. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this section, BPW may authorize additional positions to meet public emergencies
resulting from an act of God and violent acts of man that are necessary to protect the health
and safety of the people of Maryland.

– 318 –

PAGE 319
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 101

BPW may authorize the creation of additional positions within the Executive Branch
provided that 1.25 contractual full–time equivalents (FTE) are abolished for each regular
position authorized and that there be no increase in agency funds in the current budget
and the next two subsequent budgets as the result of this action. It is the intent of the
General Assembly that priority is given to converting individuals that have been in
contractual FTEs for at least 2 years. Any position created by this method may not be
counted within the limitation of 100 under this section. The numerical limitation on the
creation of positions by BPW established in this section may not apply to positions entirely
supported by funds from federal or other non–State sources so long as both the appointing
authority for the position and the Secretary of Budget and Management certify for each
position created under this exception that:

(1) funds are available from non–State sources for each position
established under this exception; and

(2) any positions created will be abolished in the event that non–State
funds are no longer available. The Secretary of Budget and Management shall certify and
report to the General Assembly by June 30, 2024, the status of positions created with
non–State funding sources during fiscal 2021 through 2024 under this provision as
remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.

SECTION 35. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That immediately following the
close of fiscal 2023, the Secretary of Budget and Management shall determine the total
number of full–time equivalent (FTE) positions that are authorized as of the last day of
fiscal 2023 and on the first day of fiscal 2024. Authorized positions shall include all
positions authorized by the General Assembly in the personnel detail of the budgets for
fiscal 2023 and 2024, including nonbudgetary programs, the Maryland Transportation
Authority, the University System of Maryland self–supported activities, and the Maryland
Correctional Enterprises.

The Department of Budget and Management shall also prepare a report during fiscal
2024 for the budget committees upon creation of regular FTE positions through Board of
Public Works action and upon transfer or abolition of positions. This report shall also be
provided as an appendix in the Governor’s Fiscal 2025 Budget Books. It shall note, at the
program level:

(1) where regular FTE positions have been abolished;

(2) where regular FTE positions have been created;

(3) from where and to where regular FTE positions have been transferred;
and

(4) where any other adjustments have been made.

Provision of contractual FTE information in the same fashion as reported in the

– 319 –

PAGE 320
Ch. 101 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND
