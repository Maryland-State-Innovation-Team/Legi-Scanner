Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022 to select a new headquarters site from among three
finalist sites, including Greenbelt, Maryland, Landover, Maryland, and Springfield,
Virginia; and

WHEREAS, The goal of the new FBI headquarters project is to consolidate all
headquarters employees into a single facility to both improve the mission of the FBI and to

cybersecurity with the National Security Agency, Cyber Command, and the Defense
Information Systems Agency at Fort George G. Meade, the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt,
the U.S. Secret Service Training Center in Laurel, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms

headquarters in Prince George’s County will give the FBI greater ability to diversify its
workforce, along with close access to Bowie State University, a historically Black college or
university, which could provide a pipeline of diverse employees; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly of Maryland stands united that it is in the best
interests of the United States of America that the headquarters of the FBI be located at a
site that can meet the current security standards, be situated in the middle of a diverse
community with a large, educated workforce, be close to major transportation links and
other defense and cybersecurity agencies as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, and
that the sites at Greenbelt and Landover best meet those requirements; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly of Maryland is committed to fully supporting the
relocation of the FBI headquarters, including supporting employee relocation efforts and
improving transportation infrastructure at both the Greenbelt and Landover sites; now,
therefore, be it
