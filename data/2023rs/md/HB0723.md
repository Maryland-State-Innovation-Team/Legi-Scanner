(a) The preferred sequence for afforestation and reforestation shall be established
by the State or local authority in accordance with the following after all techniques for
retaining existing forest cover on–site have been exhausted:

(1) Those techniques that enhance existing forest and involve selective
clearing or supplemental planting on–site;

(2) On–site afforestation or reforestation may be utilized where the
retention options have been exhausted. In those cases, the method shall be selected in
accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the location shall be selected in
accordance with subsection (d) of this section;

(3) (i) Off–site afforestation or reforestation in the same watershed or
in accordance with an approved master plan may be utilized where the applicant has
demonstrated that no reasonable on–site alternative exists, or where:

1. Any on–site priority areas for afforestation or
reforestation have been planted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section; and

2. The applicant has justified to the satisfaction of the State
or local jurisdiction that environmental benefits associated with off–site afforestation or
reforestation would exceed those derived from on–site planting;

(ii) In these cases, the method shall be selected in accordance with
subsection (b) of this section, and the location shall be selected in accordance with
subsection (d) of this section; and

(iii) Off–site afforestation or reforestation may include the use of
forest mitigation banks which have been so designated in advance by the State or local
forest conservation program which is approved by the Department; and

(b) Standards for meeting afforestation or reforestation requirements shall be
established by the State or local program using one or more of the following methods:
