section.

(b) For a contract of life insurance or an annuity contract, it is not discrimination

abatement of premiums is fair, equitable to, and in the best interest of policyholders.

(c) For policies of life insurance or health insurance issued on the industrial debit,
preauthorized check, bank draft, or similar plans, it is not discrimination or a rebate to
make an allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a specified period made
premium payments directly to an office of the insurer or by preauthorized check, bank draft,
or similar plans in an amount that fairly represents the savings in collection expense.

policy based on the loss or expense experience under the policy, at the end of any policy
year, retroactive only for that policy year.

similar plan issued in smaller amounts.

insurance or annuity contracts on a salary savings or payroll deduction plan or other
distribution plan at a reduced rate reasonably commensurate with the savings made by use
