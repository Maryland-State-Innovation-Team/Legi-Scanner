(Senate Bill 377)

AN ACT concerning

Workers’ Compensation – Benefits – Offset and ~~Hearing~~ ~~Loss~~ Study

FOR the purpose of altering the circumstances under which the payment of a benefit by a
governmental unit or quasi–public corporation to a covered employee offsets the
liability for benefits under the workers’ compensation law; ~~altering~~ ~~the~~ ~~method~~ ~~used~~
~~to~~ ~~determine~~ ~~the~~ ~~deduction~~ ~~required~~ ~~to~~ ~~be~~ ~~made~~ ~~to~~ ~~allow~~ ~~for~~ ~~the~~ ~~average~~ ~~amount~~ ~~of~~
~~hearing~~ ~~loss~~ ~~from~~ ~~nonoccupational~~ ~~causes~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~population~~ ~~for~~ ~~purposes~~ ~~of~~
~~calculating~~ ~~workers’~~ ~~compensation~~ ~~benefits~~ ~~for~~ ~~occupational~~ ~~deafness;~~ ~~requiring~~
~~tinnitus~~ ~~to~~ ~~be~~ ~~considered~~ ~~part~~ ~~of~~ ~~a~~ ~~covered~~ ~~employee’s~~ ~~hearing~~ ~~loss;~~ ~~requiring~~ ~~that~~
~~benefits~~ ~~awarded~~ ~~related~~ ~~to~~ ~~hearing~~ ~~loss~~ ~~be~~ ~~awarded~~ ~~without~~ ~~adjustment~~ ~~due~~ ~~to~~ ~~offset~~
~~against~~ ~~other~~ ~~benefits;~~ ~~requiring~~ ~~the~~ ~~Joint~~ ~~Committee~~ ~~on~~ ~~Workers’~~ ~~Compensation~~
~~Benefit~~ ~~and~~ ~~Insurance~~ ~~Oversight~~ ~~to~~ ~~conduct~~ ~~a~~ ~~certain~~ ~~evaluation~~ stating that it is the
intent of the General Assembly that the Maryland Association of Counties and the
Professional Fire Fighters of Maryland jointly research and report certain
information; and generally relating to workers’ compensation benefits.

That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:

Article – Labor and Employment

9–610.

(a) (1) Except for benefits subject to an offset under § 29–118 of the State
Personnel and Pensions Article, if a statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, regulation, or
policy, regardless of whether part of a pension system, provides a benefit to a covered
employee of a governmental unit or a quasi–public corporation that is subject to this title
under § 9–201(2) of this title or, in case of death, to the dependents of the covered employee,
payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability
~~[similar]~~of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for payment of benefits under
this title ONLY IF THE PAYMENT OF THE BENEFIT BY THE EMPLOYER AND THE
PAYMENT FOR BENEFITS UNDER THIS TITLE ARE BASED ~~ON~~ ~~THE~~ ~~SAME~~ ~~ACCIDENTAL~~
~~DISEASE,~~ PART,~~INJURY~~ ~~OR~~ ~~OCCUPATIONAL~~ IN WHOLE OR IN ON THE SAME BODY
PART.

(2) If a benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than the

provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit paid under
paragraph (1) of this subsection and the benefits provided under this title.

(3) The computation of an additional benefit payable under paragraph (2)
of this section shall be done at the time of the initial award and may not include any cost
of living adjustment after the initial award.

(b) (1) If federal law provides benefits for an individual who is a covered
employee of the Military Department of the State under § 9–215 of this title that are equal
to or greater than the benefits provided by this title, the covered employee is not entitled
to benefits under this title.

(2) If federal law provides benefits for a covered employee of the Military
Department of the State that are less than the benefits provided by this title, the State and
its insurer shall provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit
provided by federal law and the similar benefit provided by this title.

(c) (1) The Commission may:

(i) determine whether any benefit provided by the employer is equal
to or greater than any benefit provided for in this title; and

(ii) make an award against the employer or the Subsequent Injury
Fund or both to provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit
provided by the employer and the benefits required by this title.

(2) A claim that comes under this section is subject to the continuing
powers and jurisdiction of the Commission.
