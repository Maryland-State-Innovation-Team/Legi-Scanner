(House Bill 1191)

AN ACT concerning

Task Force on Preventing and Countering Elder Abuse

FOR the purpose of establishing the Task Force on Preventing and Countering Elder
Abuse; and generally relating to the Task Force on Preventing and Countering Elder
Abuse.

Preamble

WHEREAS, The proportion of Maryland’s population age 60 and older is growing
more rapidly than other components of the population. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates
that 22% of Maryland’s population will be 60 and older by the year 2030, an increase of
26% from 2012, and the number of Marylanders 65 or older is expected to double by 2030
(about 1.2 million people, or nearly one in every five Marylanders). The fastest growing
population are people age 85 and older – people who are at increased risk for a variety of
illnesses and dementias resulting in greater risk for abuse and exploitation; and

WHEREAS, According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, only
4.5% of older adults live in nursing homes; only 2% in assisted living facilities; and the
majority of older adults, 93.5%, live in the community; and

WHEREAS, According to the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and
Victim Services, in 2015, an older adult is abused every 5 seconds in Maryland; and

WHEREAS, According to the National Council on Aging, 1 in 10 adults age 60 and
older are being abused; and

WHEREAS, The National Council on Aging reports that only 1 in 24 cases of elder
abuse are reported to authorities, and the National Adult Protective Services Association
reports that only 1 in 44 cases of financial abuse are ever reported. True Link Financial
estimates that 37% of seniors are affected by financial abuse in any 5–year period and the
National Council on Aging estimates the annual loss by victims of financial abuse to be at
least $36.5 billion; and

WHEREAS, § 14–101 of the Family Law Article defines “abuse” as the sustaining of
any physical injury by a vulnerable adult as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as
a result of a malicious act by any person; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly is committed to protecting vulnerable adults and
all older adults from abuse, neglect, abandonment, human trafficking, and exploitation;
and

WHEREAS, § 14–101 of the Family Law Article defines “vulnerable adult” as an
adult who lacks physical or mental capacity to provide for the adult’s daily needs; and

WHEREAS, Laws need to be enacted pertaining to older adults not deemed
vulnerable; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly wishes to affirm its commitment to the
well–being and safety of all of its older adult community members and to ensure that they
will be protected and their rights respected; and

WHEREAS, Each of our elected leaders has the ability and obligation to promote
safety for all older adults, including healthy and productive aging, and bringing an end to
abusers not being held accountable for the harm they inflict; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly wishes to affirm its commitment to the provision
of a comprehensive, integrated set of laws that protect victims of elder abuse and
exploitation; and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly wishes to affirm its commitment to enabling the
courts to issue fair, just, and appropriate judgments against abusers by being educated
about elder abuse and being able to recognize inherent elder abuse in cases which do not
appear to be elder abuse crimes but rather other crimes committed against older adults;
and

WHEREAS, Maryland’s laws on elder abuse need to be reviewed, updated, and
expanded to better protect Maryland’s seniors; now, therefore,
