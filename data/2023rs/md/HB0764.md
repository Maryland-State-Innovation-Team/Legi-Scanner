administrator shall name the jointly appointed mediator–arbitrator on or before December
7.

(3) Notwithstanding appointment of the mediator–arbitrator panel, this
subsection does not require beginning mediation–arbitration before the date set forth in
subsection (b)(2) of this section.

(b) (1) During the collective bargaining:

(i) either party may declare an impasse and request the services of
the mediator–arbitrator panel; or

(ii) the parties may jointly request the services of a
mediator–arbitrator panel before an impasse is declared.

(2) If the mediator–arbitrator panel finds in the discretion of the panel that
the parties are at a bona fide impasse, or on February 1, if they still have not agreed on a
contract, whichever happens first, the mediator–arbitrator panel shall require the parties
to submit:

(i) a joint memorandum listing all items to which the parties have
previously agreed; and

(ii) a separate memorandum of the party’s last final offer presented
in negotiations on all items to which the parties have not previously agreed.

(c) (1) On or before February 10, if the parties have not agreed on a contract,
the mediator–arbitrator panel shall hold a nonpublic hearing on the parties’ proposals at a
time, date, and place chosen by the mediator–arbitrator panel.

(2) Each party shall submit evidence or make oral and written argument
in support of the party’s last final offer.

(3) The mediator–arbitrator panel may not open the hearing to a person
who is not a party to the mediation–arbitration.

(d) (1) On or before February 15, the mediator–arbitrator panel shall issue a
report choosing the final offer that the mediator–arbitrator panel determines to be more
reasonable when viewed as a whole.

(2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, in determining the more
reasonable offer, the mediator–arbitrator panel may consider only:

(i) past collective bargaining contracts between the parties,
including the bargaining history that led to the agreement or the precollective bargaining
history of employee wages, hours, benefits, and other working conditions;

(ii) a comparison of wages, hours, benefits, and conditions of
employment of similar employees of other public employers in the Washington
Metropolitan Area and in the State;

(iii) a comparison of wages, hours, benefits, and conditions of
employment of similar employees of private employers in Montgomery County;

(iv) the public interest and welfare;

(v) the ability of the employer to finance any economic adjustments
required under the proposed agreement;

(vi) the effects of any economic adjustments on the standard of public
services normally provided by the employer; and

(vii) the annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for all items
as shown in the most recent Consumer Price Index – Wage Earners and Clerical Workers
(“CPI–W”) for the Washington Metropolitan Area.

(3) In considering the terms and conditions of the final offer regarding
wages, the mediator–arbitrator panel shall first consider and give the highest priority to
the ability of the Montgomery Commission to pay for additional short–term and long–term
expenses by considering:

(i) the limits on the ability of the Montgomery Commission to raise
revenue;

(ii) the added burden raising revenue would have on customers of
the Montgomery Commission; and

(iii) the ability of the Montgomery Commission to continue providing
the current level of service to its customers.

(4) In determining the more reasonable offer, the mediator–arbitrator
panel shall consider that all items on which the parties agreed before the
mediation–arbitration are integrated with each offer.

(5) The mediator–arbitrator panel may not receive or consider the history
of collective bargaining relating to the immediate dispute, including any offers of
settlement not contained in the offer submitted to the mediator–arbitrator panel.

(e) The mediator–arbitrator panel may not compromise or alter the final offer
that the mediator–arbitrator panel chooses.
