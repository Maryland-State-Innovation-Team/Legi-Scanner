– 10 –

PAGE 11
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 240

(ii) A certifying agency shall determine whether a business is
independent by considering:

1. the date the business was established;

2. the adequacy of the resources of the business for the work
required under the contract;

3. the degree to which financial, equipment leasing, and
other relationships with nonminority businesses vary from industry practice; and

4. any other relevant factor.

(3) A minority owner shall have real, substantial, and continuing
ownership and control of the business that goes beyond the pro forma ownership of the
business as reflected in the ownership documents.

(4) A minority owner shall have the customary incidents of ownership and
share in the risks and profits commensurate with the ownership interests in the business
as demonstrated by an examination of the substance rather than the form of the
arrangements.

(5) Recognition of the business as a separate entity for tax or corporate
purposes is not necessarily sufficient for certification as a minority business enterprise.

(6) (i) A minority owner shall have the power to:

1. direct or cause the direction of the management and
policies of the business; and

2. make the day–to–day and major decisions on matters of
management, policy, and operations for the business.

(ii) The business may not be subject to a formal or informal
restriction, including a bylaw, partnership agreement, or charter requirement for
cumulative voting rights, that prevents a minority owner from making a business decision
without the cooperation or vote of an owner who is not a minority.

(7) (i) The business may not be operated disproportionately by the
owners of the business who are not minorities.

(ii) If the management of the business is contracted out to an
individual other than the owner, the individual who has the ultimate power to hire and fire

(8) (i) Minorities shall directly hold all securities that constitute
ownership or control of a corporation for the purpose of establishing the corporation as a
minority business enterprise.

considered held by minorities in determining the ownership or control of a corporation.

(9) A contribution of capital or expertise by a minority owner to acquire an
interest in a business shall be real and substantial and may not include:

(i) a promise to contribute capital;

(ii) a note payable to the business or owners of the business who are
not socially and economically disadvantaged; or

(iii) participation as an employee and not as a manager.

(c) In determining eligibility as a minority business enterprise, a certifying
agency shall:

(1) closely scrutinize a newly formed business, or a business for which the
ownership or control has changed since the date of the advertisement of the contract, to
determine the reason for the timing of the formation or change;

(2) carefully review a previous or continuing employer–employee
relationship among present owners to ensure that an employee–owner has the
management responsibilities and capabilities required under this section; and

(3) carefully review a relationship between a minority business enterprise
and a business that is not a minority business enterprise that has an interest in the
minority business enterprise to determine if the interest of the nonminority business
section.]conflicts with the ownership and control requirements of this
