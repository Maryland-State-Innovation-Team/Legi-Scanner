WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 240

(4) BASED ON ITS REVIEW OF THE DISPARITY STUDY:

(I) THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE DISPARITIES THAT ARE STRONG EVIDENCE OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MINORITIES AND NONMINORITY WOMEN IN WAGES,
BUSINESS FORMATION, BUSINESS OWNER EARNINGS, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN
THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND INDUSTRY CATEGORIES IN WHICH THE
COMMISSION DOES BUSINESS;

(II) THE COMMISSION WOULD BECOME A PASSIVE PARTICIPANT
IN PRIVATE SECTOR RACIAL AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION IF IT ELIMINATED ITS
REMEDIAL EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE OPERATION OF THE MINORITY BUSINESS
ENTERPRISE UTILIZATION PROGRAM ESTABLISHED UNDER § 20–204 OF THIS
SUBTITLE;

(III) THERE REMAIN SUBSTANTIAL AND STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE DISPARITIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST MINORITIES AND NONMINORITY WOMEN IN THE COMMISSION’S OWN
PROCUREMENT DESPITE THE COMMISSION’S ASSERTIVE EFFORTS TO CURTAIL
THAT DISCRIMINATION;

(IV) THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE DISPARITIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST BUSINESSES OWNED BY MINORITIES AND NONMINORITY WOMEN IN ALL
MAJOR INDUSTRY CATEGORIES IN WHICH THE COMMISSION PROCURES GOODS AND
SERVICES;

(V) THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT DISCRIMINATION IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR HAS DEPRESSED BUSINESS FORMATION AND BUSINESS GROWTH
AMONG MINORITY AND NONMINORITY WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN THE
GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND INDUSTRY CATEGORIES IN WHICH THE COMMISSION
DOES BUSINESS; AND

(VI) THERE IS POWERFUL AND PERSUASIVE QUALITATIVE
EVIDENCE, BOTH STATISTICAL AND ANECDOTAL, OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
MINORITY AND NONMINORITY WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE SECTORS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND INDUSTRY CATEGORIES IN
WHICH THE COMMISSION DOES BUSINESS;

(5) AS A RESULT OF ONGOING DISCRIMINATION AND THE PRESENT
DAY EFFECTS OF PAST DISCRIMINATION, MINORITY– AND WOMEN–OWNED
BUSINESSES COMBINED CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERUTILIZED

RELATIVE TO THEIR AVAILABILITY TO PERFORM WORK IN ALL OF THE
PROCUREMENT CATEGORIES IN WHICH THE COMMISSION DOES BUSINESS;

(6) MINORITY PRIME CONTRACTORS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO
DISCRIMINATION AND CONFRONT ESPECIALLY DAUNTING BARRIERS IN
ATTEMPTING TO COMPETE WITH VERY LARGE AND LONG–ESTABLISHED
NONMINORITY COMPANIES;

(7) DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION HAS EMPLOYED, AND
CONTINUES TO EMPLOY, NUMEROUS AND ROBUST RACE–NEUTRAL REMEDIES,
INCLUDING AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH AND ADVERTISING, TRAINING AND EDUCATION,
A SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS PROGRAM, AND OTHER EFFORTS, THERE IS A STRONG
BASIS IN EVIDENCE THAT DISCRIMINATION PERSISTS EVEN IN PUBLIC SECTOR
PROCUREMENT WHERE THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED;

(8) THIS SUBTITLE ENSURES THAT RACE–NEUTRAL EFFORTS WILL BE
USED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT FEASIBLE AND THAT RACE–CONSCIOUS MEASURES
WILL BE USED ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION THAT WAS
NOT ALLEVIATED BY RACE–NEUTRAL EFFORTS;

(9) THIS SUBTITLE CONTINUES AND ENHANCES EFFORTS TO ENSURE
THAT THE COMMISSION LIMITS THE BURDEN ON NONMINORITY BUSINESSES AS
MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY ENSURING THAT ALL GOALS ARE DEVELOPED USING THE
BEST AVAILABLE DATA AND THAT WAIVERS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN CONTRACTORS
MAKE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS;

(10) THIS SUBTITLE ENSURES THAT THE OPERATION OF THE MINORITY
BUSINESS ENTERPRISE UTILIZATION PROGRAM ESTABLISHED UNDER § 20–204 OF
THIS SUBTITLE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DISPARITY STUDY DATA AND IS NARROWLY
TAILORED TO THE COMPELLING INTERESTS OF THE STATE; AND

(11) COMMISSION EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
COMPETITIVELY VIABLE BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN AND MINORITIES WILL
ASSIST IN REDUCING DISCRIMINATION AND CREATING JOBS FOR ALL CITIZENS OF
MARYLAND.
