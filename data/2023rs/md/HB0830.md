shall include separate estimates:

(i) for EV–ready and EVSE–installed parking spaces;

(ii) based on the following assumptions:

1. that at least 10% of the parking spaces will be required to
be EV–ready or EVSE–installed;

2. that at least 25% of the parking spaces will be required to
be EV–ready or EVSE–installed; and

3. that at least 50% of the parking spaces will be required to
be EV–ready or EVSE–installed; and

(iii) for the following categories of parking:

1. open air parking lots;

2. underground parking structures; and
