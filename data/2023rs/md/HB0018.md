SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:

Article – Estates and Trusts

17–202.

“MARYLAND STATUTORY FORM

PERSONAL FINANCIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY

IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WARNING

You should be very careful in deciding whether or not to sign this document. The powers
granted by you (the principal) in this document are broad and sweeping. This power of
attorney authorizes another person (your agent) to make decisions concerning your
property for you (the principal). Your agent will be able to make decisions and act with

– 1 –
END OF PAGE 1

START OF PAGE 2
Ch. 696 2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

respect to your property (including your money) whether or not you are able to act for
yourself.

You should select someone you trust to serve as your agent. Unless you specify otherwise,
generally the agent’s authority will continue until you die or revoke the power of attorney
or the agent resigns or is unable to act for you.

You need not grant all of the powers listed below. If you choose to grant less than all of the
listed powers, you may instead use a Maryland Statutory Form Limited Power of Attorney
and mark on that Maryland Statutory Form Limited Power of Attorney which powers you
intend to delegate to your attorney–in–fact (the Agent) and which you do not want the
Agent to exercise.

YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT GRANTING YOUR AGENT THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE
ACTIONS UNDER THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY MAY:

(1) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE YOUR PROPERTY AND LIMIT YOUR
ACCESS TO YOUR ASSETS;

(2) CHANGE HOW YOUR PROPERTY IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER YOUR
EXISTING ESTATE PLANS TO YOUR HEIRS OR OTHERS ON YOUR DEATH; OR

(3) RESULT IN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS.

This power of attorney becomes effective immediately unless you state otherwise in the
Special Instructions.

You should obtain competent legal advice before you sign this power of attorney if you have
any questions about the document or the authority you are granting to your agent.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR AGENT

SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE GRANTED A POWER OF ATTORNEY DOES NOT MEAN YOU
SHOULD EXERCISE IT. YOU ARE BOUND BY AN UTMOST DUTY OF LOYALTY TO THE
INTERESTS OF THE PRINCIPAL. YOU MAY NOT ACT IN YOUR OWN SELF–INTEREST.
YOU ARE FURTHER LIMITED BY LEGAL DUTIES TO THE PRINCIPAL THAT GOVERN
YOUR ACTIONS.

WHEN EXERCISING THE AUTHORITY GRANTED IN THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY, YOU
SHALL CONSIDER THE STATED INTENTIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL REGARDING THE
PRINCIPAL’S SELF–INTEREST, FAMILY, ESTATE, AND TAXES.

DESIGNATION OF AGENT

This section of the form provides for designation of one agent.

“MARYLAND STATUTORY FORM LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

This power of attorney authorizes another person (your agent) to make decisions concerning
your property for you (the principal). You need not give to your agent all the authorities
listed below and may give the agent only those limited powers that you specifically indicate.
This power of attorney gives your agent the right to make limited decisions for you. You
should very carefully weigh your decision as to what powers you give your agent. Your
agent will be able to make decisions and act with respect to your property (including your
money) whether or not you are able to act for yourself.

If you choose to make a grant of limited authority, you should check the boxes that identify
the specific authorization you choose to give your agent.

This power of attorney does not authorize the agent to make health care decisions for you.

You should select someone you trust to serve as your agent. Unless you specify otherwise,
generally the agent’s authority will continue until you die or revoke the power of attorney
or the agent resigns or is unable to act for you.

Your agent is not entitled to compensation unless you indicate otherwise in the special
instructions of this power of attorney. If you indicate that your agent is to receive
compensation, your agent is entitled to reasonable compensation or compensation as
specified in the Special Instructions.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR AGENT

Agent’s Duties

When you accept the authority granted under this power of attorney, a special legal
relationship is created between you and the principal. This relationship imposes on you
legal duties that continue until you resign or the power of attorney is terminated or revoked.
You must:

(1) Do what you know the principal reasonably expects you to do with the
principal’s property or, if you do not know the principal’s expectations, act in the principal’s
best interest;

(2) Act with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal;

(3) Do nothing beyond the authority granted in this power of attorney; and

(4) Disclose your identity as an agent whenever you act for the principal by
writing or printing the name of the principal and signing your own name as “agent” in the
following manner:

(2) Avoid conflicts that would impair your ability to act in the principal’s best
interest;

(3) Keep a record of all receipts, disbursements, and transactions made on behalf
of the principal;

(4) Cooperate with any person that has authority to make health care decisions
for the principal to do what you know the principal reasonably expects or, if you do not
know the principal’s expectations, to act in the principal’s best interest; and

(5) Attempt to preserve the principal’s estate plan if you know the plan and
preserving the plan is consistent with the principal’s best interest.

Termination of Agent’s Authority

You must stop acting on behalf of the principal if you learn of any event that terminates
this power of attorney or your authority under this power of attorney. Events that
terminate a power of attorney or your authority to act under a power of attorney include:

(1) Death of the principal;

(2) The principal’s revocation of the power of attorney or your authority;

(3) The occurrence of a termination event stated in the power of attorney;

(4) The purpose of the power of attorney is fully accomplished; or

(5) If you are married to the principal, a legal action is filed with a court to end
your marriage, or for your legal separation, unless the Special Instructions in this power of
attorney state that such an action will not terminate your authority.

Liability of Agent

The meaning of the authority granted to you is defined in the Maryland Power of Attorney
Act, Title 17 of the Estates and Trusts Article. If you violate the Maryland Power of
Attorney Act, Title 17 of the Estates and Trusts Article, or act outside the authority
granted, you may be liable for any damages caused by your violation.

If there is anything about this document or your duties that you do not understand, you
should seek legal advice.”
