audio–only telephone conversation between a health care provider and a patient;

(ii) an electronic mail message between a health care provider and a

(i) shall provide coverage under a health insurance policy or
contract for health care services appropriately delivered through telehealth regardless of
the location of the patient at the time the telehealth services are provided;

(ii) may not exclude from coverage a health care service solely
because it is provided through telehealth and is not provided through an in–person
consultation or contact between a health care provider and a patient; and

(iii) may not exclude from coverage or deny coverage for a behavioral
health care service that is a covered benefit under a health insurance policy or contract
when provided in person solely because the behavioral health care service may also be

(4) assess the adequacy of reimbursement for behavioral health services
