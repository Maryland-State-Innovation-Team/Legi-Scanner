increasing the maximum acceptable global warming potential for a category of
eligible materials; requiring a unit of State government to specify the eligible
materials that will be used in an eligible project in the solicitation for an eligible
project; requiring a successful bidder or offeror of an eligible project to submit certain
information about each eligible material proposed to be used in an eligible project;
