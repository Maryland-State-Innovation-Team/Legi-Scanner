WHEREAS, The Chesapeake Bay is intrinsic to life in Maryland, as it is a part of
the State’s identity and local culture and is a vibrant part of Maryland’s history and State
pride both environmentally and economically; and

WHEREAS, The health of Baltimore’s waterfront, from the Inner Harbor to the Port
of Baltimore, is critical to the State as a major driver of Central Maryland’s economy, but
also as an important environmental feeder to the sustainability of the Chesapeake Bay;
and

WHEREAS, The redevelopment of Baltimore’s waterfront will ensure increased
tourism spending, new jobs, and more equitable access to the water for the Central
Maryland region; and

WHEREAS, The State has a financial interest in the success of Baltimore City’s
economy, both for State revenues and for local quality of life, and the reinvestment and
redevelopment in Baltimore’s waterfront as a destination location advances that interest;
