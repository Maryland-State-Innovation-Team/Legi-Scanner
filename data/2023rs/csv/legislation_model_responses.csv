It mandates a structured process to identify and mitigate disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens on vulnerable populations, including a cost-benefit analysis covering economic, employment, education, health, and environmental justice impacts, and requires publishing these analyses for public transparency. This proactive and transparent approach to embedding social equity into infrastructure planning is a significant governmental innovation.",8,"This bill has a high potential for an indirect impact on child poverty by mandating that transportation decisions consider and mitigate disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens on low-income communities.
