participating political subdivisions of the State, other public entities, and the private sector 
Ch. 68  2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 2 – of the economy in the provision of adequate waste disposal fac ilities, including facilities 
that provide for energy generation and resource recovery and facilities that generate steam, 
electricity, or other forms of energy from fuels derived from or otherwise related to waste 
disposal facilities; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The M aryland Environmental Service was created by the General 
Assembly in 1970 to provide dependable, effective, and efficient water supply and 
purification and disposal of liquid and solid wastes, encourage reductions in the amount of 
waste generated and disch arged to the environment, encourage the generation of energy 
and the recovery of useable resources from waste to the extent practicable, promote the 
conservation of energy use, enable and provide for the production of energy from solid 
wastes and renewable  and other sources, encourage private sector participation in 
environmental protection, and serve its political subdivisions and economic interests; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The Maryland Clean Energy Center was created by the General 
Assembly in 2008 to encourage th e development of clean energy industries in the State, 
encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies in the State, help attract and retain 
business activity and commerce in clean energy technology in the State, promote economic 
development, and pro mote the health, safety, and welfare of residents of the State; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority developed  
waste –to–energy facilities in Harford County, Montgomery County, and Baltimore City; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, The waste –to–energ y facility in Harford County closed in 2016; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The local government in Montgomery County stated an intention to 
close the waste –to–energy facility in the county, the contract for which terminates in April 
2026; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Baltimore City’s contract to send trash to the waste –to–energy facility 
in Baltimore City terminates in December 2031, and Baltimore County’s contract to send 
trash to the waste –to–energy facility in Baltimore City terminates in September 2026; and  
 
 WHEREAS, On formation of the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority in 
1980, the General Assembly contemplated that, under the appropriate conditions, the 
Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority could merge into the Maryland 
Environmental Service under § 3 –924 of the N atural Resources Article; and  
 
 WHEREAS, In its December 2021 report, the State Transparency and Accountability 
Reform Commission recommended that each agency the Commission reviewed, including 
the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, should underg o a review at least once 
every 8 years, conducted by the legislature and similar to a sunset review, to assess the 
agency’s statutory compliance with its mission and vision; and  
 
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 68  
 
– 3 –  WHEREAS, A 2017 report, Written Report of George D. Thurston Regarding the 
Public Health Impacts of Air Emissions From the Wheelabrator Facility, found that air 
pollution from the Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Company waste –to–energy facility 
causes $55 million in health damages annually for the region; and  
 
 WHEREAS, An analysi s by the Environmental Integrity Project demonstrates that 
Maryland’s two remaining waste –to–energy facilities emit significantly more mercury and 
nitrogen oxides per unit of energy than the State’s remaining coal plants; and  
 
 WHEREAS, In Appendix E of its December 2021 report, the State Transparency and 
Accountability Reform Commission states, “It was brought to the Commission’s attention 
that the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority (NMWDA) has a provision within 
its statute (Natural Resources S ection 3 –924) that allows them to merge within the 
Maryland Environmental Services (MES). Given that, to the Commission’s knowledge, 
NMWDA does not have any outstanding bonds, it may be appropriate to consolidate them 
into MES since their work overlaps. Th is could help eliminate any redundancies and 
integrate the efforts of both agencies to better serve the state.”; now, therefore,
