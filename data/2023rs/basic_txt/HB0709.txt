Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Substantial risk and waste are generated from the continued use of the 
State’s existing accounting and payments platform, the Financial Management and 
Information System (FMIS), due to limited development resources , cybersecurity risks, and 
difficulties delivering functional enhancements to meet evolving end –user needs and 
legislative mandates; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The State must consider how future systems will integrate across the 
State’s broader ecosystem and understan d that there is substantial risk if key finance 
functions remain fractured in multiple systems; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The State’s financial systems and applications are operated and 
maintained by different departments, which contributes to a complex information 
technology ecosystem and governance challenges; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The Office of the Comptroller, as the chief financial officer of the State, 
should lead the effort to consolidate and modernize the financial systems under a single 
Ch. 23  2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND

Treasurer, the Department of Budget and Management, the Department of Information 
Technology, an d the Department of General Services to consolidate and modernize the

 WHEREAS, Because the Modernize Maryland Oversight Commission is responsible 
for a substantial amount of the State’s information technology and cybersecurity 
collaboration, input and participation by that body and the constituent agencies it supports 
will be essential to the creation of the 21st Century Financial Systems Enterprise; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Because the  State has multiple information technology modernization 
initiatives currently underway that may impact the implementation of a new financial 
management and payroll system, a coordinated strategy and strong legislative directive is 
required to minimize add itional information technology complexities, technical debt, 
process inefficiency, and overall cost; now, therefore,
