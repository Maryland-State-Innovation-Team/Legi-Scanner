company’s transmission and distribution facilities; and  
 
   (iii) is intended primarily to offset all or part of the customer’s own 
electricity requirements.  
 
  (7) “Net energy metering” means measurement of the difference between 
the electricity that is supplied by an electric company and the electricity that is generated 
by an eligible customer –generator and fed back to the electric grid over the eligible 
customer –generator’s billing period.  
 
  (8) “Net excess generation” means the amount of the electricity generated 
by an eligible customer –generator that is in excess of the electricity consumed by the 
eligible customer –generator and that results in a negative kilowatt –hour reading at the 
end o f the eligible customer –generator’s billing cycle.  
 
 (f) (1) The electric company shall calculate net energy metering in accordance 
with this subsection.  
 
  (2) Net energy produced or consumed on a regular basis shall be measured 
in accordance with standard metering practices.  
 
  (3) If electricity supplied by the grid exceeds electricity generated by the 
eligible customer –generator during a month, the eligible customer –generator shall be billed 
for the net energy supplied in accordance with subsecti on (e) of this section.  
 
  (4) If electricity generated by the eligible customer –generator exceeds the

GENERATION FOR A PER IOD AUTHORIZED UNDER  ITEM 1 OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH . 
 
   (ii) The electric company shall carry forward net e xcess generation 
until:  
 
    1. the eligible customer –generator’s consumption of

paragraph expires ; OR 
 
    3. THE ACCOUNT  IS CLOSED . 
 
   (iii) 1. [The] IF AN ELIGIBLE CUSTOM ER–GENERATOR 
ELECTS TO ACCRUE NET  EXCESS GENERATION FO R A PERIOD NOT TO EX CEED 12 
MONTHS UNDER SUBPARA GRAPH (I)1 OF THIS PARAGRAPH , THE dollar value of net 
excess generation shall be equal to the generation or commodity portion of the rate that the 
eligible customer –generator would have been charged by the electric company averaged 
over the previous 12 –month period ending with the billing  cycle that is complete 
immediately [prior to ] BEFORE  the end of [April ] AUGUST  multiplied by the number of 
kilowatt –hours of net excess generation.  
 
    2. For [customers ] AN ELIGIBLE CUSTOMER –GENERATOR 
THAT ELECTS TO ACCRU E NET EXCESS GENERAT ION UNDER SU BPARAGRAPH (I)1 OF 
THIS PARAGRAPH AND I S served by a community choice aggregator or an electricity 
supplier, the dollar value of the net excess generation shall be equal to the generation or
