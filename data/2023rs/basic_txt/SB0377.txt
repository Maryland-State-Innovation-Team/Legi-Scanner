(Senate Bill 377 ) 
 
AN ACT concerning  
 
Workers’ Compensation – Benefits – Offset and Hearing Loss  Study  
 
FOR the purpose of altering the circumstances under which the payment of a benefit by a 
governmental unit or quasi –public corporation to a covered employee offsets the 
liability for benefits under the workers’ compensation law; altering the method used 
to determine the deduction required to be made to allow for the average amount of 
hearing loss from nonoccupational causes in the population for purposes of 
calculating workers’ compensation benefits for occupational deafness; requiring 
tinnitus to be conside red part of a covered employee’s hearing loss; requiring that 
benefits awarded related to hearing loss be awarded without adjustment due to offset 
against other benefits;  requiring the Joint Committee on Workers’ Compensation 
Benefit and Insurance Oversight to conduct a certain evaluation  stating that it is the 
intent of the General Assembly that the Maryland Association of Counties and the 
Professional Fire Fighters of Maryland jointly research  and report certain 
information;  and generally relating  to workers’ compensation benefits.  
 
BY repealing and reenacting, with amendments,  
 Article – Labor and Employment  
Section 9 –610 and 9 –650 
 Annotated Code of Maryland  
 (2016 Replacement Volume and 2022 Supplement)  
 
 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,

Article – Labor and Employment  
 
9–610. 
 
 (a) (1) Except for benefits subject to an offset under § 29 –118 of the State 
Personnel and Pensions Article, if a statute, charter, ordinance , resolution, regulation, or 
policy, regardless of whether part of a pension system, provides a benefit to a covered 
employee of a governmental unit or a quasi –public corporation that is subject to this title 
under § 9 –201(2) of this title or, in case of d eath, to the dependents of the covered employee, 
payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability 
of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for payment of [similar ] benefits under 
this title ONLY  IF THE PAYMENT OF TH E BENEFIT BY THE EMP LOYER AND THE 
PAYMENT FOR BENEFITS  UNDER THIS TITLE ARE  BASED ON THE SAME ACCIDENT AL 
INJURY OR  OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE , IN WHOLE OR IN PART , ON THE SAME BODY 
PART .

– 2 –  
  (2) If a benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this su bsection is less than the 
benefits provided under this title, the employer, the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall 
provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit paid under 
paragraph (1) of this subsection and the benefits provided under this title.  
 
  (3) The computation of an additional benefit payable under paragraph (2) 
of this section shall be done at the time of the initial award and may not include any cost 
of living adjustment after the initial award.  
 
 (b) (1) If federal law provides benefits for an individual who is a covered 
employee of the Military Department of the State under § 9 –215 of this title that are equal 
to or greater than the benefits provided by this title, the covered employee is not entitled 
to benef its under this title.  
 
  (2) If federal law provides benefits for a covered employee of the Military 
Department of the State that are less than the benefits provided by this title, the State and 
its insurer shall provide an additional benefit that equals t he difference between the benefit 
provided by federal law and the similar benefit provided by this title.  
 
 (c) (1) The Commission may:  
 
   (i) determine whether any benefit provided by the employer is equal 
to or greater than any benefit provided for in t his title; and  
 
   (ii) make an award against the employer or the Subsequent Injury 
Fund or both to provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit 
provided by the employer and the benefits required by this title.  
 
  (2) A claim that comes under this section is subject to the continuing 
powers and jurisdiction of the Commission.  
 
9–650. 
 
 (a) (1) Hearing loss shall be measured by audiometric instrumentation that 
meets the following criteria:  
 
   (i) ANSI 3.6 –1996;  
 
   (ii) ANSI S3.43 –1992; and  
 
   (iii) ANSI 3.39 –1987 or any ANSI standard that supersedes the 
previous calibration or measurement criteria.  
 
  (2) Measurements shall be conducted in a sound room that meets the ANSI 
3.1–1991 criteria for maximum permissible ambient  noise for audiometric test rooms.  
 WES  MOORE, Governor  Ch. 410  
 
– 3 –  
  (3) Behavioral psychoacoustic measurements shall be obtained with 
instrumentation that utilizes insert earphones, as referenced in ANSI 3.6 –1996.  
 
  (4) Electrodiagnostic measurements such as auditory evoked potentials , 
acoustic emittance measurements, or distortion product otoacoustic emissions may be 
obtained to determine the nature and extent of workplace hearing loss.  
 
  (5) Audiologic results shall be used in conjunction with other information 
to evaluate a claiman t’s compensable hearing loss.  
 
 (b) (1) The percentage of hearing loss for purposes of compensation for 
occupational deafness shall be determined by calculating the average, in decibels, of the 
thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000 , and 3,000 hertz in accordance 
with paragraph (2) of this subsection.  
 
  (2) The average of the thresholds in hearing shall be calculated by:  
 
   (i) adding together the lowest measured losses in each of the 4 
frequencies; and  
 
   (ii) dividing the total by 4.  
 
  (3) To allow for the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational 
causes found in the population at any given age, there shall be deducted from the total 
average decibel loss determined under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection THE 
LESSER OF : 
 
   (I) one–half of a decibel for each year of the covered employee’s age 
over 50 [at the time of the last exposure to industrial noise ]; OR 
 
   (II) ONE–HALF OF A DECIBEL FO R EACH YEAR SUBSEQUE NT TO  
THE DATE OF THE COVE RED EMPLOYEE ’S LAST INJURIOUS EXPOSURE T O 
INDUSTRIAL NOISE . 
 
 (c) (1) If the average hearing loss in the 4 frequencies determined under 
subsection (b) of this section is 25 decibels or less, the covered employee does not have a 
compensable hearing loss.  
 
  (2) If the average hearing loss in the 4 frequencies determined under 
subsection (b) of this section is 91.7 decibels or more, the covered employee has a 100% 
compensable hearing loss.  
 
  (3) For every decibel that the average hearing loss exceeds 25 decibels, the 
covered em ployee shall be allowed 1.5% of the compensable hearing loss, up to a maximum 
of 100% compensable hearing loss at 91.7 decibels.  
Ch. 410  2023 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 4 –  
 (d) The binaural percentage of hearing loss shall be determined by:  
 
  (1) multiplying the percentage of hearing loss in the better ear by 5;  
 
  (2) adding that product to the percentage of hearing loss in the poorer ear; 
and 
 
  (3) dividing that sum by 6.  
 
 (e) (1) In determining the percentage of hearing loss under this section, 
consideration may not be given to whether the use of an amplification device improves the 
ability of a covered employee to understand speech or enhance behavioral hearing 
thresholds.  
 
  (2) (i) In determining a workers’ compensation claim for noise –related 
hearing loss, audiologic data shall use both bone conduction and air conduction results.  
 
   (ii) If a conductive loss is present, the bone conduction thresholds for 
each ear, rather than the air conduction levels, shall be used to calculate a claimant’s 
average hearing loss.  
 
 (F) (1) TINNITUS SHALL  BE CONSIDERED PART O F A COVERED  
EMPLOYEE ’S HEARING LOSS UNDER  THIS SECTION . 
 
  (2) WHEN DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE OF HEARIN G LOSS  
ATTRIBUTABLE TO TINN ITUS , THE COMMISSION SHALL : 
 
   (I) CONSIDER THE EVALUAT ION REQUIRED UNDER § 9–721( A) 
AND (B) OF THIS TI TLE; AND  
 
   (II) ADD THE PERCENTAGE O F HEARING LOSS ATTRI BUTABLE  
TO TINNITUS TO THE H EARING LOSS PERCENTA GE DETERMINED UNDER  
SUBSECTION (D) OF THIS SECTION TO D ETERMINE THE TOTAL P ERCENTAGE OF THE  
COVERED EMPLOYEE ’S HEARING LOSS . 
 
 (G) BENEFITS PROVIDED UNDER THIS SECTION S HALL BE AWARDED  
WITHOUT AN ADJUSTMEN T BEING MADE UNDER § 9–610 OF THIS SUBTITLE .  
 
 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That it is the intent of the General
