Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, The General Assembly of Maryland granted general authority to 
Baltimore City to develop a water supply system within and outside of its borders, impound 
and withdraw water from the Gunpowder River, the Patapsco River, and the Little 
Gunpowder River, and withdraw water from the Susquehanna River; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The water supply system developed by Baltimore City has supported 
the development and expansion of adjacent regional counties; and

Baltimore County authorizing Baltimore County to construct, maintain, and operate 
wastewater systems within the Metropolitan District and required Baltimore City to 
extend the water supply lines within the Metropolitan District; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Chapter 729 of 1939 authorized Baltimore County to enter into  
contractual agreements with Baltimore City for the disposal of wastewater and for the 
establishment, construction, operation, and maintenance of and costs associated with the 
water supply and wastewater systems; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Baltimore County and Baltim ore City entered into agreements in 1945 
and 1963, and, most recently, in 1972 and 1974 recognizing that “substantial increases in 
population, volume of sewage, operation and maintenance costs, and costs of construction” 
for the jointly –used water and wast ewater systems compelled updates to the jurisdiction 
management and funding of the systems; and  
 
 WHEREAS, In 1991, arbitration clarified that individuals who use water services 
within the Metropolitan District were customers of Baltimore City’s water syst em and were 
principals of Baltimore County in the provision of water services; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Due to regional population growth, Baltimore City’s water and 
wastewater system now provides water and wastewater service to additional jurisdictions, 
including A nne Arundel County, Carroll County, Harford County, and Howard County and 
now serves more than 1.8 million regional residents; and

 WHEREAS, In accordance with Title 9, Subtitle 5 of the Environment Article, 
Baltimore City alone develops the plans for wat er supply and wastewater systems, 
including operations, maintenance, and capital investments, while Baltimore County pays 
their proportionate share of the costs; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Baltimore City and Baltimore County jointly engaged consultants to 
conduct a co mprehensive business process review to identify strengths and weaknesses of 
the current governance, planning, data management, and operations of the water and 
wastewater utilities, to identify opportunities to improve interjurisdictional collaboration, 
and to understand the current state of the structures and processes for the delivery of water 
and wastewater services, including operations, planning, and billing, the results of which 
were finalized in July 2021 in the Water/Sewer Services Comprehensive Busi ness Process 
Review; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The consultants provided several models of governance and operations

collaboration, and specifically recommended the exploration of al ternative governance 
structures; and

governance of several existing regional models for water and wastewater across the
