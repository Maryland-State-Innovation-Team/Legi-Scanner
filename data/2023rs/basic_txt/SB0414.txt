Commission to Advance and Strengthen Fire Fighting and Emergency Medical 
Services  Within Maryland  
 
FOR the purpose of establishing the Commission to Advance and Strengthen Fire Fighting 
and Emergency Medical Services  Within Maryland to study and make 
recommendations regarding the effectiveness and viability of certain incentives, 
offerings, or practices  employed in other states to attract, support, and retain 
individuals in fire fighting and emergency medical services  roles; and generally 
relating to the Commission to Advance and Strengthen Fire Fighting and Emergency 
Medical Services  Within Maryland.  
 
Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, The lives and property of Maryland residents and businesses are all 
protected and benefit greatly from strong and efficient fire, rescue, and emergency medical 
service response systems, coordinated at the county and community level acr oss Maryland; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, The social and demographic makeup of communities has largely shifted, 
presenting both career and volunteer fire companies great difficulty in recruiting and 
retaining individuals for service; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Appropriate training standards for fire and emergency medical  service 
in either a career or volunteer capacity are important but also create a meaningful barrier 
to new entrants into any fire fighting or emergency medical service  capacity; and  
 
 WHEREAS, A stark shortage of available recruits and on –duty firefighters and 
emergency medical services personnel  have caused fire companies to call on volunteers who 
are well into ages 60 and 70 years old for primary response to fire and emergency medical  
calls; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Volunteer fire companies remain deeply embedded in many 
communities, serving as the primary fire fighting and emergency medical  response across 
large parts of the State; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Relatively metropolitan parts of the State rely o n coordinated services 
from both career and volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel  to 
provide needed service coverage, but face strains in finding adequate participation at both 
levels; and

poses  and emergency medical serv ices personnel pose  an urgent and high priority concern 
for Marylanders’ safety and security in the short term and long term; now, therefore,
