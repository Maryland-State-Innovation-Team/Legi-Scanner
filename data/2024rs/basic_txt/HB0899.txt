 WHEREAS, Appropriate educational attainment in the fire and emergency medical 
service in either a career or volunteer capacity is important but also creates a meaningful 
barrier t o new entrants into any fire fighting or emergency medical service capacity; and  
 
 WHEREAS, A stark shortage of available recruits and on –duty firefighters and 
emergency medical services personnel has caused fire companies to call on volunteers who 
are wel l into their 60s and 70s for primary response to fire and emergency medical calls; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, Volunteer fire companies remain deeply embedded in many 
communities, serving as the primary fire fighting and emergency medical response across 
large parts of  the State; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Relatively metropolitan parts of the State rely on coordinated services 
from both career and volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel to 
provide needed service coverage, but face strains in finding adequate  participation at both 
levels; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Maryland and its local governments currently offer a variety of support 
incentives, staff benefits, and other compensation targeted to career and volunteer fire 
company members and those working in emergency medical services; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The recruitment and retention of both career and volunteer firefighters 
and emergency medical services personnel pose an urgent and high priority concern for 
Marylanders’ safety and security in the short term and long term;  and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Maryland General Assembly, through Chapter 655 of the Acts of the 
General Assembly of 2023, created the Commission to Advance and Strengthen Fire 
Fighting and Emergency Medical Services Within Maryland to develop a set of
