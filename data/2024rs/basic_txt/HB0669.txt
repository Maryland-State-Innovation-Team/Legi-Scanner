(House Bill 669 ) 
 
AN ACT concerning  
 
Workers’ Compensation – Benefits – Hearing Loss  
 
FOR the purpose of altering the frequencies in which industrial noise must be for  an 
employer to be required to provide workers’ compensation to a covered employee for 
hearing loss;  altering the method used to determine the percentage of hearing loss 
deafness for purposes of workers’ compensation; altering the method used to 
determine the deduction required to be made to allow for the average amount of 
hearing loss from nonoccupational causes in the population for purposes of 
calculating workers’ compensation benefits for occupational deafness; requiring 
tinnitus to be considered part o f a covered employee’s hearing loss;  and generally 
relating to workers’ compensation benefits.  
 
BY repealing and reenacting, with amendments,  
 Article – Labor and Employment  
Section 9–505 and  9–650 
 Annotated Code of Maryland  
 (2016 Replacement Volume and 2023 Supplement)  
 
 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, 
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:  
 
Article – Labor and Employment  
 
9–505. 
 
 (a) Except as otherwise provided, an employer shall provide compensation in 
accordance  with this title to a covered employee for loss of hearing by the covered employee 
due to industrial noise in the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, [and] 3,000 , AND 4,000  hertz.  
 
 (b) An employer is not liable for compensation for occupational deafness und er 
subsection (a) of this section unless the covered employee claiming benefits worked for the 
employer in employment that exposed the covered employee to harmful noise for at least 
90 days.   
 
9–650. 
 
 (a) (1) Hearing loss shall be measured by audiometric instrumentation that 
meets the following criteria:  
 
   (i) ANSI 3.6 –1996;  
 
Ch. 282  2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 2 –    (ii) ANSI S3.43 –1992; and  
 
   (iii) ANSI 3.39 –1987 or any ANSI standard that supersedes the 
previous calibration or measurement criteria.  
 
  (2) Measurements shall be conducted in a sound room that meets the ANSI 
3.1–1991 criteria for maximum permissible ambient noise for audiometric test rooms.  
 
  (3) Behavioral psychoacoustic measurements shall be obtained with 
instrumentation that utilizes insert earphones, as referenced in ANSI 3.6 –1996.  
 
  (4) Electrodiagnostic measurements such as auditory evoked potentials, 
acoustic emittance measurements, or distortion product otoacoustic emissions may be 
obtained to determine the nature and extent of workplace hearing loss.  
 
  (5) Audio logic results shall be used in conjunction with other information 
to evaluate a claimant’s compensable hearing loss.  
 
 (b) (1) The percentage of hearing loss for purposes of compensation for 
occupational deafness shall be determined by calculating the aver age, in decibels, of the 
thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, [and] 3,000 , AND 4,000  hertz 
in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.  
 
  (2) The average of the thresholds in hearing shall be calculated by:  
 
   (i) addin g together the lowest measured losses in each of the [4] 5 
frequencies; and  
 
   (ii) dividing the total by [4] 5. 
 
  (3) To allow for the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational 
causes found in the population at any given age, there shall be de ducted from the total 
average decibel loss determined under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection one –half of 
a decibel for each year of the covered employee’s age over 50 [at the time of the last exposure 
to industrial noise ] OR FOR EACH YEAR SUB SEQUE NT TO THE DATE OF TH E COVERED 
EMPLOYEE ’S LAST INJURIOUS EXP OSURE TO INDUSTRIAL NOISE , WHICHEVER IS 
LESS . 
 
 (c) (1) If the average hearing loss in the [4] 5 frequencies determined under 
subsection (b) of this section is 25 decibels or less, the covered empl oyee does not have a 
compensable hearing loss.  
 
  (2) If the average hearing loss in the [4] 5 frequencies determined under 
subsection (b) of this section is 91.7 decibels or more, the covered employee has a 100% 
compensable hearing loss.  
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 282  
 
– 3 –  
  (3) For every decibel that the average hearing loss exceeds 25 decibels, the 
covered employee shall be allowed 1.5% of the compensable hearing loss, up to a maximum 
of 100% compensable hearing loss at 91.7 decibels.  
 
 (d) The binaural percentage of hearing loss shall be  determined by:  
 
  (1) multiplying the percentage of hearing loss in the better ear by 5;  
 
  (2) adding that product to the percentage of hearing loss in the poorer ear; 
and 
 
  (3) dividing that sum by 6.  
 
 (E) (1) TINNITUS SHALL BE CON SIDERED PART OF A COVERED  
EMPLOYEE ’S HEARING LOSS UNDER  THIS SECTION .  
 
  (2) WHEN DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE OF HEARIN G LOSS  
ATTRIBUTABLE TO TINN ITUS , THE COMMISSION SHALL : 
 
   (I) CONSIDER THE PROVISI ONS OF § 9–721( A) OF THIS TITLE  
AND THE APPLICABLE P ROVISIONS OF § 9–721(B) OF THIS TITLE ; AND  
 
   (II) ADD THE PERCENTAGE O F HEARING LOSS ATTRI BUTABLE  
TO TINNITUS TO THE H EARING LOSS PERCENTA GE DETERMINED UNDER  
SUBSECTION (D) OF THIS SECTION TO D ETERMINE THE TOTAL P ERCENTAGE OF THE  
COVERED EMPLOYEE ’S HEARING LOSS . 
 
  (3) A COVERED EMPLOYEE MAY H AVE A COMPENSABLE CL AIM FOR  
HEARING LOSS ATTRIBU TABLE TO TINNITUS UN DER THIS SUBSECTION IN THE  
ABSENCE OF A COMPENS ABLE CLAIM FOR HEARI NG LOSS UNDER SUBSEC TIONS (B) 
THROUGH (D) OF THIS SECTION .  
 
 [(e)] (F) (1) In determining the percen tage of hearing loss under this section, 
consideration may not be given to whether the use of an amplification device improves the 
ability of a covered employee to understand speech or enhance behavioral hearing 
thresholds.  
 
  (2) (i) In determining a workers’ compensation claim for noise –related 
hearing loss, audiologic data shall use both bone conduction and air conduction results.  
 
   (ii) If a conductive loss is present, the bone conduction thresholds for 
each ear, rather than the air conduction lev els, shall be used to calculate a claimant’s 
average hearing loss.

– 4 –  SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect 
October 1, 2024.  
 
Approved by the Governor, April 25, 2024.
