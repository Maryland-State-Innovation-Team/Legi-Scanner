Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes 
that children need special safeguards and care in all aspects of their lives, specifying how 
children’s rights apply in the digit al environment in General Comment No. 25; and  
 
 WHEREAS, As children spend more of their time interacting with the online world, 
the impact of the design of online products on their well –being has become a focus of 
significant concern; and  
 
Ch. 461  2024 LAWS OF  MARYLAND   
 
– 2 –  WHEREAS, There  is widespread agreement at the international level, and 
bipartisan agreement in the United States, that more needs to be done to create a safer 
online space for children to learn, explore, and play; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Lawmakers around the globe have taken steps to enhance privacy 
protections for children based on the understanding that, in relation to data protection, 
greater privacy necessarily means greater security and well –being; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Children should be afforded protections not only by online products and 
services specifically directed at them, but by all online products they are likely to access, 
and thus covered entities should take into account the unique needs of different age ranges, 
including the following developmental stages: 0 to 5 yea rs of age, or “preliterate and early 
literacy”; 6 to 9 years of age, or “core primary school years”; 10 to 12 years of age, or 
“transition years”; 13 to 15 years of age, or “early teens”; and 16 to 17 years of age, or 
“approaching adulthood”; and  
 
 WHEREAS , While it is clear that the same data protection regime may not be 
appropriate for children of all ages, children of all ages should nonetheless be afforded 
privacy and protection, and online products should adopt data protection regimes 
appropriate for c hildren of the ages likely to access those products; and  
 
 WHEREAS, According to the Pew Research Center, in 2022, 97% of American 
teenagers aged 13 –17 used the Internet every day, with 46% responding they used the 
Internet almost constantly; and, addition ally, 36% of teens reported being concerned about 
their social media use, while an earlier Pew Research Center study found that 59% of teens 
have been bullied or harassed online; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The findings of the Pew Research Center are not surprising, gi ven what 
is known about controllers’ use of personal data and how it is utilized to inform 
manipulative practices, to which children are particularly vulnerable; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Online products that are likely to be accessed by children should offer 
strong privacy protections that, by design, prevent the use of children’s personal data to 
offer elements that the covered entity offering the online product knows, or has reason to 
know, are likely to be materially detrimental to the physical health, mental heal th, or  
well–being of children; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Ensuring robust privacy, and thus safety, protections for children by 
design is consistent with federal safety laws and policies applied to children’s products, 
regulating everything from toys to clothing to f urniture and games; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The consumer protections that federal safety laws apply to children’s 
products require these products to comply with certain safety standards by their very 
design, so that harms to children, and in some cases other consum ers, are prevented; and  
 
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 461  
 
– 3 –  WHEREAS, It is the intent of the Maryland General Assembly that the Maryland 
Age–Appropriate Design Code Act promote innovation by covered entities whose online 
products are likely to be accessed by children by ensuring that those  online products are 
designed in a manner that recognizes the distinct needs of children within different age 
ranges; and now, therefore,  
 
 WHEREAS, It is the intent of the Maryland General Assembly that covered entities 
covered by the Maryland Age–Appropriate Design Code Act may look to guidance and 
innovation in response to the Age –Appropriate Design Code established in the United 
Kingdom and California when developing online products that are likely to be accessed by 
children; now, therefore,
