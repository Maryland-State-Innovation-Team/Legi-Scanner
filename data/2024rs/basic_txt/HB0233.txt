Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Following extensive research and the issuance of a report by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency that clearly demonstrated the alarming extent of 
degradation of the Chesapeake Bay, in significant part because of prominent land use and 
growth patterns, the Critical Area Commission was created in 1984 in order to preserve 
and restore water quality in the State, to maintain valued wildlife habitat, and  to 
accommodate inevitable growth, and these same legislative concerns were addressed in 
2002 when the protections of the Critical Area Program were expanded to include the 
Atlantic Coastal Bays and in 2008 with the comprehensive update to the Critical Are a 
Program; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The critical area, which comprises approximately 11% of Maryland’s 
land mass, includes the majority of the State’s most ecologically fragile and valuable 
properties; and  
 
 WHEREAS, From its inception, partnership between State and  local government 
has been a cornerstone of the Critical Area Program; and  
 
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 424  
 
– 3 –  WHEREAS, To date local critical area programs are operative in Baltimore City, 16 
counties, and 47 other municipalities, and critical area issues directly impact at least seven 
State departments; and  
 
 WHEREAS, After nearly 40 years of operation, the Critical Area Program has 
effectively influenced thousands of land use decisions, addressed and minimized the 
adverse impacts of growth associated with hundreds of requests for growth allocation, and 
represented a comprehensive effort between the State and local governments to enforce a 
variety of water quality and habitat protection standards; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Despite these efforts, additional measures are necessary to enhance a 
cooperat ive land use and natural resource management program that will restore the 
quality and productivity of the Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic Coastal Bays, their tidal 
tributaries, and associated land –based ecosystems; and  
 
 WHEREAS, As a member of the Maryland Commission on Climate Change, the 
Critical Area Commission is charged with recommending short and long –term strategies 
and initiatives to better mitigate, prepare for, and adapt to the consequences of climate 
change; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Particularly in light of  the ongoing, accelerating decline of the State’s 
water quality resources and the loss of valuable shoreline areas due to erosion, sea level 
rise, and climate change, the Critical Area Commission has a significant role in ensuring 
the adaptation of Marylan d’s tidal waters, developed shorelines, and their adjacent 
resource lands and wildlife habitats to the rapidly evolving climate realities; and  
 
 WHEREAS, To address the increasing effects on water quality from more frequent 
and higher –intensity storms, to adjust conservation programs and techniques to the 
shifting realities of species and habitats, and to accommodate appropriate levels and 
locations for growth within the critical area, improvements to the Critical Area Program 
are in order at this time; and  
 
 WHEREAS, It is in the interest of the citizens of Maryland that the Critical Area 
Commission ensure the equitable distribution of the environmental benefits and burdens 
of development, restoration, and mitigation within the critical area and, in doing s o, the 
Commission must also ensure equitable representation and participation in its processes; 
now, therefore,

Article – Natural Resources  
 
8–1801.  
 
 (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:  
 
  (1) The Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries 
are natural resources of great significance to the State and the nation, and their beauty, 
their ecological value, and their economic impact all reach far beyond any one local 
jurisdiction;  
 
  (2) The shoreline and adjacent lands, particularly the buffer areas, 
constitute a valuable, fr agile, and sensitive part of this estuarine system, where human 
activity can have a particularly immediate and adverse impact on water quality and 
natural habitats;  
 
Ch. 424  2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 6 –   (3) The capacity of these shoreline and adjacent lands to withstand 
continuing demands , INCLUDING CLIMATE CH ANGE , without further degradation to 
water quality and natural habitats is limited;  
 
  (4) Human activity is harmful in these shoreline areas, where the new 
development of nonwater –dependent structures AND USES or an increase in lot cov erage 
is presumed to be contrary to the purpose of this subtitle, because these activities may 
cause OR AMPLIFY adverse impacts, of both an immediate and a long –term nature, to the 
Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays, and thus it is necessary [whereve r possible ] to 
maintain a buffer of at least 100 feet landward from the mean high water line of tidal 
waters, tributary streams, and tidal wetlands;  
 
  (5) National studies have documented that the quality and productivity of 
the waters of the Chesapeake B ay and its tributaries have declined due to the cumulative 
effects of human activity that have caused increased levels of pollutants, nutrients, and 
toxics in the Bay system and declines in more protective land uses such as forestland and 
agricultural land  in the Bay region;  
 
  (6) Those portions of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and 
their tributaries within Maryland are particularly stressed by the continuing population 
growth and development activity concentrated in the Baltimore –Washington metropolitan 
corridor and along the Atlantic Coast;  
 
  (7) The quality of life for the citizens of Maryland is enhanced through the 
restoration of the quality and productivity of the waters of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic 
Coastal Bays [,] and their tribu taries IN A MANNER IN WHICH  BURDENS AND BENEFITS  
ARE DISTRIBUTED EQUI TABLY ; 
 
  (8) The restoration of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and 
their tributaries is dependent, in part, on minimizing further adverse impacts to the water 
quality and natural habitats of the shoreline and adjacent lands, AND ENHANCING THE 
RESILIENCY O F NATURAL RESOURCES IN  THE CRITICAL AREA, particularly in the 
buffer;  
 
  (9) The cumulative impact of current development and of each new 
development activity in the buffer is inimical to these purposes, and it is therefore 
imperative that State law protec t irreplaceable State buffer resources from unpermitted 
activity; [and] 
 
  (10) There is a critical and substantial State interest for the benefit of 
current and future generations in fostering more sensitive development and more effective 
enforcement in a  consistent and uniform manner along shoreline areas of the Chesapeake 
and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries so as to minimize damage to water 
quality and natural habitats ; 
 
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 424  
 
– 7 –   (11) THERE IS A CRITICAL A ND SUBSTANTIAL STATE INTEREST IN 
DEVELOP ING POLICIES AND STR ATEGIES TO BETTER MI TIGATE , PREPARE FOR , AND 
ADAPT TO THE CONSEQU ENCES OF CLIMATE CHA NGE ALONG THE STATE’S 
SHORELINES , INCLUDING SEA LEVEL RISE , STORM SURGE ,  
PRECIPITATION –INDUCED FLOODING , AND OTHER EXTREME WE ATHER EVENTS AND 
TO ENHAN CE THE RESILIENCE OF  THE STATE’S SHORELINES BY IDEN TIFYING , 
RESTORING , CREATING , AND CONSERVING EXIST ING NATURAL AND NATU RE–BASED 
FEATURES ; 
 
  (12) THERE IS A CRITICAL A ND SUBSTANTIAL STATE INTEREST IN 
ENSURING THE EQUITAB LE DISTRIBUTION OF T HE BENEFITS AN D BURDENS OF 
DEVELOPMENT , RESTORATION , MITIGATION , AND CONSERVATION ALO NG THE 
STATE’S SHORELINES AND IN ENSURING EQUITABLE R EPRESENTATION AND 
PARTICIPATION IN THE SE PROCESSES ; AND 
 
  (13) THE INCLUSION OF INCE NTIVE–BASED PROGRAMS TO EN SURE 
DEVELOPMENT IS C OMPATIBLE WITH PROJE CTED CLIMATE IMPACTS  AND COASTAL 
HAZARDS IS VITAL TO THE STATE’S GOAL OF ADDRESSING  CLIMATE RESILIENCY . 
 
 (b) It is the purpose of the General Assembly in enacting this subtitle:  
 
  (1) To establish a Resource Protection Program for the  Chesapeake and the 
Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries by fostering more sensitive development 
activity for certain shoreline areas so as to minimize damage to water quality and natural 
habitats; and  
 
  (2) To implement the Resource Protection Pro gram on a cooperative basis 
between the State and affected local governments, with local governments establishing and 
implementing their programs in a [consistent and ] CONSISTENT , uniform , AND 
EQUITABLE  manner subject to State and local leadership, criteri a, and oversight.
