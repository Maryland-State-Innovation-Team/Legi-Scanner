AN ACT concerning  
 
Department of General Services – State Buildings and Facilities – Energy 
Conservation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction s 
 
FOR the purpose of altering the State’s goals for reducing energy consumption in State 
buildings; requiring the Maryland Green Building Council to update the High  
Performance Green Building Program to ensure that the Program  aligns with  certain 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals ; requiring  the Department of General 
Services to identify State –owned facilities that are potential candidates for energy 
performance contracts ; altering requirements for certain energy audits , data 
collect ion processes, and requests for proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions  
from State facilities ; requiring  each unit of State government to implement projects 
and initiatives to conserve energy and reduce the unit’s greenhouse gas emissions; 
and genera lly relating to the conservation of energy  in, and reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions  from, State buildings and facilities.

 (a) So that it can audit and evaluate competing design proposals, the Department 
shall set standards for energy performance indices.  
 
 (b) As experience develops on the energy performance achieved in State buildings, 
the energy performance indices will serve as a measure of building performanc e with 
respect to energy consumption.  
 
 (c) The Department, in cooperation with the Maryland Energy Administration, 
shall assist State agencies in reducing, by [2029] 2031 , the average energy consumption 
in State buildings by [10%] 20% from the level in fi scal year 2018.

energy –efficient State –owned buildings.  
 
 (e) The energy audit shall identify low –cost measures for increasing energy 
efficiency that, over the following 5 years, will result in energy cost savings that meet or 
exceed the costs of the measures.  
 
 (f) The Department shall provide a copy of the energy audit to the head of each 
unit of State government that occupies the spaces audited.  
 
 (g) Each unit of State government that occupies the space audited shall 
implement the measures identified in the energy audit to the fullest  extent practicable.  
 
 (h) For 1 year following the implementation of the measures identified in the 
energy audit, the Department shall:  
 
  (1) monitor the unit’s energy use;  
 
  (2) track any changes resulting from the measures; and

 (i) (1) In this subsection, “Database” means the Comprehensive Utility 
Records Management Database.  
 
  (2) The Department shall establish and maintain the Comprehensive 
Utility Records Management Database for the purpose of trackin g the changes in energy 
consumption resulting from the implementation of the measures identified in the energy 
audit.  
 
  (3) The Department shall collect the data and information necessary to 
fully populate, update, and maintain the Database.  
 
  (4) Each m onth, each unit of State government shall make available to the 
Department all available data about its facilities and copies of the unit’s utility bills.  
 
 (j) Each unit of State government shall, in support of the unit’s core missions, 
implement projects  and initiatives to conserve energy and reduce energy consumption.  
 
 (k) The Department, the Maryland Energy Administration, the Department of 
Budget and Management, and the Department of Information Technology shall collaborate

initiatives.  
 
 (l) Beginning July 1, 2020, provisions promoting the State’s energy efficiency 
goals shall be included in requests for proposals that:  
 
  (1) are for the leasing of space to the State; and  
 
  (2) would obligate the State to pay the utility bills for the leased space.  
 
 (m) Each fiscal year, with the advice and assistance of the Maryland Energy
