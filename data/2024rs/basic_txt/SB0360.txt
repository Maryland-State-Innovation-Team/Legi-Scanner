Amendment No. 3:  
 On page 107, strike beginning with “provided” in line 2 through “year” in line 31 on

  “provided that this appropria tion shall be for a Broadening Options and 
Opportunities for Students Today (BOOST) Program that provides scholarships for 
students who are eligible for the free or reduced price lunch program to attend eligible 
nonpublic schools. The Maryland State Depart ment of Education (MSDE) shall administer 
the grant program in accordance with the following guidelines:  
 
   (1) To be eligible to participate in the BOOST Program, a nonpublic 
school must:  
 
    (a) have participated in Program R00A03.04 Aid to  
Non–Public  Schools Program for textbooks and computer hardware and software 
administered by MSDE during the 2023 –2024 school year;  
 
    (b) provide more than only prekindergarten and kindergarten 
programs;  
 
    (c) administer national, norm –referenced standardized 
assessments chosen from the list of assessments published by the U.S. Department of 
Education to qualify nonpublic schools for the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program. The 
nonpublic schools must administer the assessments to all students as follows:  
 
     (i) English/language arts and mathematics 
assessments each year for students in grades 3 through 8, and at least once for students in 
grades 9 through 12; and  
 
Ch. 716  2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 338 –      (ii) a science assessment at least once for students in 
grades 3 through 5, at least once f or students in grades 6 through 9, and at least once for 
students in grades 10 through 12; and  
 
    (d) comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as 
amended, Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the State Government Article, and not discriminate in 
student admissions, retention, or expulsion or otherwise discriminate against any student 
on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity or 
expression. Nothing herein shall require any school or institution to adopt any rule, 
regulation, or policy that conflicts with its religious or moral teachings. However, all 
participating schools must agree that they will not discriminate in student admissions, 
retention, or expulsion or otherwise discriminate against any student based on race, color, 
national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. If a nonpublic school 
does not comply with these requirements, it shall reimburse MSDE all scholarship funds 
received under the BOOST Program for the 2024 –2025 school year and may not charge the 
student tuition and fees instead. The only other legal remedy for violation of this provision 
is ineligibility for participating in the BOOST Program.  
 
   (2) MSDE shall establish procedures for the application and award 
process for scholarships for students who are eligible for the free or reduced –price lunch 
program. The procedures shall include consideration for award adjustments if an eligible 
student becomes ineligible during the course of the school year. The BOOST Advisory Boar d 
shall prioritize awards for current BOOST recipients and their siblings and a student shall 
receive no less than the fiscal 2023 base award amount.  
 
   (3) MSDE shall compile and certify a list of applicants that ranks 
eligible students by family income expressed as a percent of the most recent federal poverty 
levels.  
 
   (4) MSDE shall submit the ranked list of applicants to the BOOST 
Advisory Board.  
 
   (5) There is a BOOST Advisory Board that shall be appointed as 
follows: 2 members appointed by the Go vernor, 2 members appointed by the President of 
the Senate, 2 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and 1 member 
jointly appointed by the President and the Speaker to serve as the chair. A member of the 
BOOST Advisory Board may not be  an elected official and may not have any financial 
interest in an eligible nonpublic school.  
 
   (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall review and certify the ranked 
list of applicants and shall determine the scholarship award amounts. The BOOST 
Advisory Boar d shall take into account the needs of students with disabilities on an 
Individualized Education Plan or 504 Plan when determining scholarship award amounts.  
 
   (7) MSDE shall make scholarship awards to eligible students as 
determined by the BOOST Advisor y Board.  
 WES MOORE, Governor  Ch. 716  
 
– 339 –  
   (8) Unless the student has special needs due to a disability, the  
amount of a scholarship award may not exceed the lesser of:  
 
    (a) the statewide average per pupil expenditure by local 
education agencies, as calculated by MSDE; or  
 
    (b) the tuition of the nonpublic school.  
 
   (9) In order to meet its BOOST Program reporting requirements to 
the budget committees, MSDE shall specify a date by which participating nonpublic schools 
must submit information to MSDE so that it may complete its required report. Any 
nonpublic schools that do not provide the necessary information by that specified date shall 
be ineligible to participate in the BOOST Program.  
 
   (10) Students who received a BOOST Program scholarship award in 
the prior year who stil l meet eligibility criteria for a scholarship shall receive a scholarship 
renewal award. For students who are receiving a BOOST Program scholarship for the first 
time, priority shall be given to students who attended public schools in the prior school 
year. 
 
  Further provided that the BOOST Advisory Board shall make all scholarship 
awards no later than December 31, 2024, for the 2024 –2025 school year to eligible 
individuals. Any unexpended funds not awarded to students for scholarships shall be 
encumbered at the end of fiscal 2025 and available for scholarships in the 2025 –2026 school 
year. ”
