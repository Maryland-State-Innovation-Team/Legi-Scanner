Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, A seamless behavioral health continuum of care that provides access to 
high quality, equitable behavioral health care is necessary for the further development of 
mental health services in Maryland; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Allowing for more options to serve individuals in cris is will help further 
strengthen Maryland’s crisis response system and better serve individuals in crisis; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Intensive outpatient services, such as assisted outpatient treatment, 
function to reduce homelessness, needless hospitalizations, arre sts, and incarcerations; and  
 
 WHEREAS, A small but persistent subset of individuals with severe mental illness 
struggle to engage voluntarily in treatment necessary to live safely in the community, in 
many cases due to an inability through no fault of the ir own to maintain awareness or 
understanding of their mental illness; and  
 
 WHEREAS, When individuals with severe mental illness remain untreated, they 
suffer needlessly from homelessness, poverty, repeated hospitalizations, repeated arrests, 
trauma, and suicide; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Civil commitment to outpatient care combined with adequate resources 
for treatment and monitoring, known in many states as “assisted outpatient treatment”, is 
a federally recognized best practice for improving treatment adherence an d outcomes 
among individuals with histories of repeated psychiatric crises while reducing systemic 
costs through avoided hospitalization; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Maryland is one of only three remaining states without statutory 
authority for a civil court to order a n individual to adhere to outpatient care; now, therefore,
