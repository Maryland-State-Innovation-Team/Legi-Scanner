and quickly became one of the first women to cover the waterfront for a major newspaper, 
and, in 1952, became the Baltimore Sun’s  maritime editor; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Bent ley’s growing expertise about the Port of Baltimore led her to 
become the host and producer of WMAR –TV’s popular series “The Port That Built a City

 WHEREAS, In 1984, B entley was elected to serve the first of five consecutive terms

distinction; and  
 
 WHEREAS, While serving as a member of Congress, Bentley worked to enact

 WHEREAS, After leaving public service and until her death in 2016 at the age of 93, 
Bentley continued to work tirelessly to advance the interests of the Port of Baltimore, so

Ehrlich, Jr., through an executive order; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Codifying the name “Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore” in statute
