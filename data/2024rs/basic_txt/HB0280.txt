– 1 – Chapter 298  
(House Bill 280 ) 
 
AN ACT concerning  
 
Local Government – Condominium and Homeowners Associations – Repair and 
Rehabilitation Funds  
 
FOR the purpose of authorizing a county or municipality to establish a certain fund for the 
purpose of providing support for the repair of infrastructure in a community subject 
to a condominium association or homeowners association; requiring that certain 
property tax revenues be assigned  to a fund created under this Act in a certain 
manner; and generally relating to public funding for the repair or rehabilitation of 
infrastructure.  
 
BY adding to  
 Article – Local Government  
Section 1–1319  
 Annotated Code of Maryland  
 (2013 Volume and 2023 Supplement)  
 
Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Many nonprofit condominium associations and homeowners 
associations in Maryland are over 50 years old, and many of the communities governed by 
these condominium associations and homeowners associations have reached the  point 
where the community is faced with significant costs to repair the physical infrastructure; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, During the past 50 years, many condominium associations and 
homeowners associations have been severely constrained by their governing documents  
that require a supermajority of all owners to approve large increases in yearly assessments, 
resulting in a backlog of unfunded infrastructure that has deteriorated and is in need of 
immediate repair despite good faith efforts by the condominium associati ons and 
homeowners associations to accumulate sufficient income to pay for these repairs; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The original developers of many of those communities, during the 
subdivision approval process, created the constraining governing documents and 
negotia ted with local government to designate roads for the community and other 
infrastructure traditionally maintained by the local government as private physical 
elements that would have to be owned and maintained by the condominium associations or 
homeowners a ssociations; and  
 
 WHEREAS, As a result of those decisions, local governments pay to maintain this 
costly infrastructure in some communities, but not in others; and  
 
Ch. 298  2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 2 –  WHEREAS, Condominium associations and homeowners associations that are 
obligated to maint ain this infrastructure cannot afford the costs of necessary repairs, which 
has led to deteriorated infrastructure that is unsafe, detracts from the appearance and 
desirability of the community, and depresses property values in the community, thereby 
negat ively impacting property tax revenues to the local governments; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Those who live in condominiums and planned communities with 
homeowners associations that are responsible for the private maintenance of this 
infrastructure are burdened by payin g for repairs and services for the types of 
infrastructure that would otherwise be paid for by local governments, as well as paying 
property taxes that support this type of infrastructure in other condominium associations 
and homeowners associations with p ublicly managed infrastructure; and  
 
 WHEREAS, There is now a greater sense of urgency from local governments to 
remove these burdens and assist condominium associations and homeowners associations 
by raising sufficient funds to repair this deteriorating i nfrastructure; now, therefore,
