 WHEREAS, Given the rapid rate of change in artificial intelligence technologies and 
industry, the State must chart a principled yet adaptable, pragmatic path forward, so that 
the technologies’ benefits can be confidently harnessed on behalf of Marylanders and in 
service of the Governor’s mission to Leave No One Behind; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Leaders across State government share a common interest in 
establishing effective artificial intelligence governance and are committed to working 
together to develo p the legal and policy framework for its responsible use in the State; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Automated systems should be safe and effective, developed with

in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of 
outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Designers, developers , and deployers of automated systems should 
consider the specific types of actions for which a human alternative is appropriate,
