Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Pursuant to Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the 
Maryland Constitution expressly provides that every person shall have the rights and 
remedies as established by the laws of Maryland including those enacted by the Maryland 
General Assembly; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Pursuant to Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, 
Maryland’s Constitution also incorporates the common law of England that existed as of 
July 4, 1776, in the Court of Law and Equity and also all Acts of Assembly in for ce and 
effective as of June 1, 1867; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Maryland law and the common law have long recognized the ability of 
an aggrieved party to recover nominal damages in an action at law and such damages affect 
the behavior of the defendant towards the pla intiff and thus independently provide redress; 
and  
 
 WHEREAS, The common law of England incorporated into Maryland’s Constitution 
has also recognized the right to reasonable nominal damages as stated by Blackstone’s 
statement, “where there is a legal righ t there is also a legal remedy, by suit or action of law, 
whenever that right is invaded ” (William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of 7 
England); and  
 
 WHEREAS, Certain conservative advocates influence to some members of the 
Supreme Court of the Unit ed States, like the Federalist Society, seek to close the courthouse 
doors to persons seeking to enforce the private and public remedies available under 
Maryland law including those related to civil rights and consumer protections; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Recent a ppellate decisions, such as the TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 
U.S. 413 (2021) and Arkansas State Conference NAACP v. Arkansas Board of 
Ch. 884  2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 2 – Apportionment, 86 F.4th 1204 (8th Cir. 2023), are examples of the recent efforts to limit the 
rights and remedies availa ble to certain protected classes of persons and consumers; and  
 
 WHEREAS, In light of the retrenchment of civil rights and consumer protections as 
exemplified by the trends of the current majority of the United States Supreme Court and 
their proponents li ke the Federalist Society, the Maryland General Assembly enacts this 
legislation to ensure that the purposes of Articles 5 and 19 of the Maryland Declaration of 
Rights are carried out by any courts interpreting Maryland law; now, therefore,
