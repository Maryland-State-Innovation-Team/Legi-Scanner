Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, At approximately 1:30 a.m. on March 26, 2024, a major section of the 
Francis Scott Key Bridge (Key Bridge) collapsed into the Patapsco River after the Dali, a 
984–foot container ship, collided with one of the bridge’s primary support pillars; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The collapse of the Key Bridge is a catastrophic event that resulted in a 
tragic loss of life and the closure  reduced operat ions of the Port of Baltimore (Port); and  
 
 WHEREAS, The closure  reduced operations  of the Port has severe economic 
implications for the entire region and nation; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The Port accounts for approximately $3.3 billion in annual personal 
income for  individuals, with approximately 15,300 jobs in Maryland directly generated by 
Port activity and approximately 140,000 total jobs linked to Port activity; and  
 
 WHEREAS, In 2023, the Port set several records for itself and also ranked first 
among ports in the nation for handling the highest volume in each of the following 
categories: autos and light trucks (847,158 vehicles); roll –on, roll –off heavy farm and 
construction machinery (1.3 million tons); and imported sugar and gypsum; and  
 
 WHEREAS, The Port also ranked ninth in the nation in 2023 for both the tonnage 
of international cargo handled (52.3 million tons) and total foreign cargo value ($80.8 
billion); and  
 
 WHEREAS, Additionally, in 2023, in total the Port exported more than $111 billion 
and impor ted more than $36 billion worth of goods; and  
 
 WHEREAS, It is critical to ensure that the individuals and businesses that are 
economically impacted by the closure  reduced operations  of the Port are supported at this 
vital juncture; now, therefore,
