AN ACT concerning  
 
Natural Resources – Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Surveys  
 
FOR the purpose of altering the definition of “aerial survey” for purposes of surveying 
submerged aquatic vegetation to include other surveys that use certain data  
encompass certain geographic areas and use certain methodologies ; requiring the 
Department of Natural Resources to study and report on the implications and 
feasibility of using alternative methods other than an aerial survey to delineate SAV 
protection zones on or before a certain date; and generally relating to submerged 
aquatic vegetation surv eys.

the previous 3 years.  
 
 (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a previously 
delineated SAV protection zone may be opened to the use of the gear set forth in subsection

   (i) [Aerial ] SAV  surveys have not shown any submerged aquatic 
vegetation in the area during th e past 3 years; or  
 
   (ii) [Aerial ] SAV  surveys have shown the density of submerged 
aquatic vegetation in that area to be less than 10% during each of the past 6 years.  
 
  (2) The areas in the vicinity of Smith Island, South Marsh Island, and
