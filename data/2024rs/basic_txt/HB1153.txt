chemicals in a certain manner; authorizing a certain significant industrial user to 
dispose of stored PFAS chemicals in a certain manner and in accordance with ce rtain 
requirements ; requiring a certain significant industrial user to measure levels of 
organic fluorine  PFAS chemicals  in industrial wastewater by a certain date and to 
report those levels to the Department of the Environment ; requiring the Department 
to update a certain action plan on or before a certain date ; and generally relating to 
State waters and PFAS pollution.
