2024 Regular Session,HB0001,Maryland Paint Stewardship,"Requiring producers of architectural paint or a representative organization to submit a plan for the establishment of a Paint Stewardship Program to the Department of the Environment by July 1, 2025, and in accordance with certain requirements; requiring the Department to review and approve certain plans, including a certain assessment; prohibiting the sale of certain architectural paint beginning January 1, 2026 unless an approved Paint Stewardship Program has been implemented by certain producers; etc.","This bill establishes the Maryland Paint Stewardship Program, requiring architectural paint producers or their representative organizations to submit a plan to the Department of the Environment by July 1, 2025. The plan must detail how postconsumer paint will be collected, transported, reused, recycled, and disposed of statewide, minimizing public sector involvement and financial responsibility. It also requires the establishment of a Paint Stewardship Assessment on architectural paint sold in the State to cover program costs. Beginning January 1, 2026, or 6 months after plan approval, producers and retailers must add this assessment to the cost of paint, and producers must participate in an approved program to sell paint in the State.

This approach is an innovative use of existing tax structures to address urban blight and encourage redevelopment, rather than implementing new technology.",5,"The program has an indirect potential to impact child poverty by incentivizing the redevelopment of vacant and abandoned properties. This could lead to revitalized communities, improved local services (if tax revenue is used for such), and potentially safer environments, which could benefit children living in poverty within those areas.

While it aims to foster greater equity in higher education, it is a policy adjustment to existing processes rather than an implementation of new technologies or fundamentally new government approaches.",2,"By removing legacy and donor preferences from college admissions, this bill aims to create a more equitable admissions process. This could indirectly benefit students from lower-income backgrounds, including those from families experiencing poverty, by reducing barriers to entry that disproportionately affect those without familial or financial connections to institutions.

It promotes a mixed-income, cross-subsidized housing model and prioritizes projects that do not rely on traditional Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, suggesting an innovative financing approach. The emphasis on public ownership and a 99-year affordability restriction for units also represents a new, long-term approach to housing stability.",7,"The program has a high potential for direct impact on child poverty by increasing the supply of deeply affordable and stable housing. By mandating that 20% of units are for households at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) or 40% at or below 60% AMI, and ensuring affordability for 99 years, it directly addresses housing insecurity and cost burdens, which are major drivers of child poverty.

2024 Regular Session,HB0013,Residential Property - Affordable Housing Land Trusts - Authority to Establish Condominium Regimes,Authorizing a condominium regime to be established on certain land owned by an affordable housing land trust.,"This bill amends Maryland's real property law to authorize affordable housing land trusts to establish condominium regimes on properties they own, specifically allowing a leasehold estate to be subjected to a condominium regime for residential purposes if an affordable housing land trust owns the reversionary fee simple estate.

It also requires charter counties to incorporate existing Assessments of Fair Housing or analyses of impediments to fair housing into their comprehensive plans when amended on or after January 1, 2024.

It repeals provisions that allowed qualified health plans to exclude essential benefits that duplicated minimum benefits of qualified dental plans under certain circumstances. Additionally, it removes the authority of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to require children enrolling in a qualified health plan to have essential pediatric dental benefits separately.
