Preamble

WHEREAS, Helen Delich Bentley was born in the copper mining town of Ruth,
Nevada, on November 28, 1923, the youngest of six children of a miner and his wife, both
of whom were Serbian immigrants; and

WHEREAS, On graduating with a journalism degree from the University of Missouri
in 1944, Bentley moved to Maryland after accepting a job with the Baltimore Sun in 1945
and quickly became one of the first women to cover the waterfront for a major newspaper,
and, in 1952, became the Baltimore Sun’s maritime editor; and

WHEREAS, Bentley’s growing expertise about the Port of Baltimore led her to
become the host and producer of WMAR–TV’s popular series “The Port That Built a City
and State”, which ran from 1950 through 1965; and

WHEREAS, Bentley used her newspaper column and television show to increase

awareness of the Port of Baltimore and to advocate for increased public investments in one
of Maryland’s greatest economic engines and job creators; and

WHEREAS, President Richard Nixon, on recognizing Bentley’s accomplishments
and reputation within the U.S. maritime industry, appointed her as Chairman of the
Federal Maritime Commission in 1969, becoming one of the first women to head a federal
regulatory agency and serving in this capacity until 1975; and

WHEREAS, In 1984, Bentley was elected to serve the first of five consecutive terms
in the U.S. House of Representatives and immediately began working to enact legislation
that would eventually result in a 50–foot channel being dredged for the world’s largest
oceangoing ships, making the Port of Baltimore the first East Coast port with that
distinction; and

WHEREAS, While serving as a member of Congress, Bentley worked to enact
bipartisan legislation that strengthened the U.S. maritime industry and made further
investments in the Port of Baltimore, and as an influential leader within the maritime
industry Bentley worked to foster greater harmony between labor and management and to
make the Port of Baltimore one of the most efficient, cost–effective, and successful seaports
in the United States; and

WHEREAS, After leaving public service and until her death in 2016 at the age of 93,
Bentley continued to work tirelessly to advance the interests of the Port of Baltimore, so
much so that the Port of Baltimore was named in her honor in 2006 by Governor Robert L.
Ehrlich, Jr., through an executive order; and

WHEREAS, Codifying the name “Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore” in statute
is a proper and deserved recognition of a Maryland citizen whose lifetime of dedicated
service and remarkable contributions to the port she loved has led her to be widely regarded
as the “Godmother of the Port”; now, therefore,
