Ch. 87 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(a) (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.

(3) “Environmental outcome” means a commodity that is modeled or
directly measured as a single, quantifiable, and certified unit of improvement to the
environment, including a nutrient or carbon benefit.

(b) The General Assembly finds and declares that:

(1) pay–for–success contracting shifts the risk of performance to the
contractor because government payment is made only on achievement of outcomes;

(2) social and environmental impact investment is growing dramatically,
and investors are seeking ways to finance and execute pay–for–success contracts in the
State to expand the success of Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts and achieve other public
outcomes; and

(3) it is in the best interest of the State to include pay–for–success
contracting as a procurement option, particularly for units responsible for land
conservation and environmental protection, enhancement, and restoration.

SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
October 1, 2024.

Approved by the Governor, April 9, 2024.
