(House Bill 280)

AN ACT concerning

Local Government – Condominium and Homeowners Associations – Repair and
Rehabilitation Funds

FOR the purpose of authorizing a county or municipality to establish a certain fund for the
purpose of providing support for the repair of infrastructure in a community subject
to a condominium association or homeowners association; requiring that certain
property tax revenues be assigned to a fund created under this Act in a certain
manner; and generally relating to public funding for the repair or rehabilitation of
infrastructure.

BY adding to
Article – Local Government
Section 1–1319
Annotated Code of Maryland
(2013 Volume and 2023 Supplement)

Preamble

WHEREAS, Many nonprofit condominium associations and homeowners
associations in Maryland are over 50 years old, and many of the communities governed by
these condominium associations and homeowners associations have reached the point
where the community is faced with significant costs to repair the physical infrastructure;
and

WHEREAS, During the past 50 years, many condominium associations and
homeowners associations have been severely constrained by their governing documents
that require a supermajority of all owners to approve large increases in yearly assessments,
resulting in a backlog of unfunded infrastructure that has deteriorated and is in need of
immediate repair despite good faith efforts by the condominium associations and
homeowners associations to accumulate sufficient income to pay for these repairs; and

WHEREAS, The original developers of many of those communities, during the
subdivision approval process, created the constraining governing documents and
negotiated with local government to designate roads for the community and other
infrastructure traditionally maintained by the local government as private physical
elements that would have to be owned and maintained by the condominium associations or
homeowners associations; and

WHEREAS, As a result of those decisions, local governments pay to maintain this
costly infrastructure in some communities, but not in others; and

Ch. 298 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

WHEREAS, Condominium associations and homeowners associations that are
obligated to maintain this infrastructure cannot afford the costs of necessary repairs, which
has led to deteriorated infrastructure that is unsafe, detracts from the appearance and
desirability of the community, and depresses property values in the community, thereby
negatively impacting property tax revenues to the local governments; and

WHEREAS, Those who live in condominiums and planned communities with
homeowners associations that are responsible for the private maintenance of this
infrastructure are burdened by paying for repairs and services for the types of
infrastructure that would otherwise be paid for by local governments, as well as paying
property taxes that support this type of infrastructure in other condominium associations
and homeowners associations with publicly managed infrastructure; and

WHEREAS, There is now a greater sense of urgency from local governments to
remove these burdens and assist condominium associations and homeowners associations
by raising sufficient funds to repair this deteriorating infrastructure; now, therefore,
