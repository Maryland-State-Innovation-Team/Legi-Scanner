AN ACT concerning

Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment and Operating Authority
Task Force

FOR the purpose of establishing the Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment
and Operating Authority Task Force to study and make recommendations
concerning the membership, purpose, and function of an ~~authority~~ entity or strategy
to govern the renovation, revitalization, financing, and ongoing maintenance and
management of a certain Baltimore Convention site and certain surrounding areas;
and generally relating to the Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment and
Operating Authority Task Force.

Preamble

WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds that the general welfare of the people of
Maryland is directly dependent on the continual encouragement, development, growth, and
expansion of business, industry, commerce, and tourism within the State and, thus, the
promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, and expansion of business, industry,
commerce, and tourism in the State should be fostered; and

WHEREAS, The Baltimore Convention site, because of its size and location in a
first–class city, is vital in attracting business, industry, commerce, and tourism to
Baltimore City, the surrounding counties, and the State as a whole; and

WHEREAS, To redevelop, revitalize, and promote the Baltimore Convention site
within this State, the Baltimore Convention Center commissioned an independent study of
convention and visitor industry governance models, day–to–day management approaches,
and funding models prevalent nationally and approaches that would be appropriate for the
future success of the Baltimore Convention Center; and

WHEREAS, An important aspect of the redevelopment and successful continuation
of the Baltimore Convention Center should be a holistic evaluation of the immediate
surrounding area and the identification of underutilized State and local real property
assets, ~~including~~ ~~the~~ ~~Hilton~~ ~~Baltimore~~ ~~Inner~~ ~~Harbor~~ ~~Hotel;~~ and

WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds, for the benefit of the people of the State,
it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of governing, redeveloping,
revitalizing, constructing, designing, managing, financing, operating, and promoting the
Baltimore Convention site and the immediate surrounding area; now, therefore,
