FOR the purpose of requiring each electric company, each gas company, and the
Department of Housing and Community Development to develop a certain plan for
achieving certain energy efficiency, conservation, and greenhouse gas emissions
reduction targets through certain programs and services and superseding certain
existing energy efficiency and conservation goals; requiring the Public Service
Commission to encourage and promote the efficient use and conservation of energy
in support of certain greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and targets in a
certain manner, including by requiring municipal electric or gas utilities and ~~small~~
~~rural~~ certain electric cooperatives to include certain programs or services as part of
their service to their customers as directed by the Commission; requiring the
Commission to require certain electric companies and certain gas companies to
include a certain disclosure on customer bills; requiring the Commission to establish
and determine certain greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets; requiring certain
contractors used for certain programs under this Act to meet certain job
requirements; requiring the Department of Housing and Community Development
to develop a plan to coordinate and leverage funding sources to support certain
energy efficiency and other home upgrades; requiring the Department of the
Environment to prepare and submit to the Commission a certain analysis; requiring
each electric company and each gas company to promote certain rebates, tax credits,
and incentives; requiring the certification agency designated by the Board of Public
Works and the Governor’s Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs,
