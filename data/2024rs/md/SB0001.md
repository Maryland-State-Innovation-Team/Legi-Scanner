(ii) on January 1, 2001, the entire industrial class and the entire
commercial class in the State of each electric company shall have the opportunity for
customer choice;

(iii) on July 1, 2001, two–thirds of the residential class in the State
of each electric company shall have the opportunity for customer choice;

(iv) on July 1, 2002, all customers of each electric company shall have
the opportunity for customer choice; and

(v) by July 1, 2003, under a separate schedule adopted by the
Commission, all customers of each electric cooperative shall have the opportunity for
customer choice.

(2) (i) In accordance with this paragraph, the Commission may adopt a
separate schedule for municipal electric utilities for the implementation of customer choice.

(ii) A municipal electric utility may not be required to make its
service territory available for customer choice unless it elects to do so.

(iii) If a municipal electric utility elects to allow customer choice, the
municipal electric utility shall file a proposed plan and schedule with the Commission.

PAGE 22
Ch. 537 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(v) Nothing in this subtitle may be construed to require the
functional, operational, structural, or legal separation of the regulated and nonregulated
operations of the municipal electric utility.

(3) If a municipal electric utility serves customers outside its distribution
territory, electricity suppliers licensed under § 7–507 of this subtitle may serve the
customers in the distribution territory of the municipal electric utility.

(b) For good cause shown and if the Commission finds the action to be in the
public interest, the Commission may:

(1) accelerate or delay the initial implementation date of July 1, 2000, by
up to 3 months; or

(2) accelerate any of the other implementation dates and phase–in
percentages in subsection (a) of this section.

(c) (1) Beginning on the initial implementation date, an electric company’s
obligation to provide electricity supply and electricity supply service is stated by this
subsection.

(I)(2) Electricity supply purchased from a customer’s electric company
is known as standard offer service.

(II) A customer is considered to have chosen the standard offer

thereafter, the Commission shall report to the Governor and, in accordance with § 2–1257
of the State Government Article, to the General Assembly on the status of the standard
service[,] competition[,offer the development of and the transition of standard offerAND

1.(4) (i) On or before July 1, 2001, the Commission shall adopt
regulations or issue orders to establish procedures for the competitive selection of wholesale
electricity suppliers, including an affiliate of an electric company, to provide electricity for
standard offer service to customers of electric companies under paragraph (2) of this
subsection, except for customers of electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities.

2. Unless delayed by the Commission, the competitive
selection shall take effect no later than July 1, 2003.

(ii) 1. Under the obligation to provide standard offer service in
[paragraph of]accordance with (3)(ii) this subsection, the Commission, by regulation or
order, and in a manner that is designed to obtain the best price for residential and small
commercial customers in light of market conditions at the time of procurement and the
need to protect these customers from excessive price increases:

A. shall require each investor–owned electric company to
obtain its electricity supply for residential and small commercial customers participating
in standard offer service through a competitive process in accordance with this paragraph;
and

B. may require or allow an investor–owned electric company
to procure electricity for these customers directly from an electricity supplier through one
or more bilateral contracts outside the competitive process.

– 23 –

PAGE 24
Ch. 537 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

2. A. As the Commission directs, the competitive process
shall include a series of competitive wholesale bids in which the investor–owned electric
company solicits bids to supply anticipated standard offer service load for residential and
small commercial customers as part of a portfolio of blended wholesale supply contracts of
short, medium, or long terms, and other appropriate electricity products and strategies, as
needed to meet demand in a cost–effective manner.

B. The competitive process may include different bidding
structures and mechanisms for base load, peak load, and very short–term procurement.

C. By regulation or order, as a part of the competitive process,
the Commission shall require or allow the procurement of cost–effective energy efficiency
and conservation measures and services with projected and verifiable energy savings to
offset anticipated demand to be served by standard offer service, and the imposition of other
cost–effective demand–side management programs.

3. A. In order to prevent an excessive amount of load
being exposed to upward price risks and volatility, the Commission may stagger the dates
for the competitive wholesale auctions.

B. By regulation or order, the Commission may allow a date
on which a competitive wholesale auction takes place to be altered based on current market
conditions.

4. By regulation or order, the Commission may allow an
investor–owned electric company to refuse to accept some or all of the bids made in a
competitive wholesale auction in accordance with standards adopted by the Commission.

5. The investor–owned electric company shall publicly
disclose the names of all bidders and the names and load allocation of all successful bidders
90 days after all contracts for supply are executed.

(5) An electric company may procure the electricity needed to meet its
standard offer service electricity supply obligation from any electricity supplier, including
an affiliate of the electric company.

(6) In order to meet long–term, anticipated demand in the State for
standard offer service and other electricity supply, the Commission may require or allow
an investor–owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own
generating facilities, and transmission facilities necessary to interconnect the generating
facilities with the electric grid, subject to appropriate cost recovery.

(7) (i) To determine whether an appropriate phased implementation of
electricity rates that is necessary to protect residential customers from the impact of
sudden and significant increases in electricity rates, the Commission in the case of an
increase of 20% or more over the previous year’s total electricity rates, shall conduct
evidentiary proceedings, including public hearings.

(ii) 1. A deferral of costs as part of a phased implementation of
electricity rates by an investor–owned electric company shall be treated as a regulatory
asset to be recovered in accordance with a rate stabilization plan under Part III of this
subtitle or any other plan for phased implementation approved by the Commission.

2. A deferral of costs under this paragraph must be just,
reasonable, and in the public interest.

(iii) The Commission shall approve the recovery of deferred costs
under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph as:

1. long–term recovery in accordance with a rate stabilization
plan under Part III of this subtitle; or

2. short–term recovery through a rate proceeding
mechanism approved by the Commission.

(iv) The Commission may approve a phasing in of increased costs by:

1. placing a cap on rates and allowing recovery over time; or

2. allowing rates to increase and providing for a rebate to
customers of any excess costs paid.

(8) (i) An electric cooperative that as of July 1, 2006, supplied its
standard offer service load through a portfolio of blended wholesale supply contracts of
short, medium, and long terms, and other appropriate electricity products and strategies,
as needed to meet demand in a cost–effective manner, may choose to continue to use a
blended portfolio:

1. as approved and modified by the electric cooperative’s
board of directors; and

2. with appropriate review for prudent cost recovery as
determined by the Commission.

(ii) The Commission may not set or enforce a termination date for
the procurement of supply through a managed portfolio previously approved by the
Commission.

(9) (i) The Commission, on request by an electric cooperative or on its
own initiative, shall initiate a proceeding to investigate options for a rate stabilization plan
to assist residential electric customers to gradually adjust to market rates over an extended
period of time.

(ii) If an electric cooperative determines that total electric rates for
residential customers are anticipated to increase by more than 20% in a 12–month period
resulting from an increase in the cost of generation, the electric cooperative shall survey its
membership to determine whether to make a request to the Commission to initiate a
proceeding under subsection (a) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, as
approved by the Commission, an electric cooperative may receive a modification in
distribution and transmission rates.
