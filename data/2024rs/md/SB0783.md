generation from more than one generating system; altering the expiration date of
renewable energy credits; requiring the Public Service Commission to establish a
Small Solar Energy Generating System Incentive Program to provide certain
certified systems with ~~a~~ ~~certain~~ ~~additional~~ ~~percentage~~ ~~of~~ ~~renewable~~ ~~energy~~ ~~credits~~
certain certified SRECs that may be put toward meeting the renewable energy
portfolio standard for solar energy; providing that a certified system is eligible to
receive ~~an~~ ~~additional~~ ~~percentage~~ ~~of~~ ~~renewable~~ ~~energy~~ ~~credits~~ ~~for~~ ~~the~~ ~~life~~ ~~cycle~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~
~~system~~ certain certified SRECs for a certain period of time; requiring an owner of a

construction of a certain ~~certified~~ solar energy generating system ~~unless~~ ~~the~~ ~~system~~
~~is~~ ~~subject~~ ~~to~~ ~~a~~ ~~certain~~ ~~project~~ ~~labor~~ ~~agreement;~~ establishing the Customer–Sited Solar
Program within the Maryland Energy Administration for the purpose of providing
grants to certain eligible customer–generators for certain solar energy generating
systems; authorizing a third party to apply for a grant on behalf of an eligible
customer–generator under certain circumstances; requiring the Administration to
publish certain information regarding the Program; requiring the Administration to
develop a certain consumer protection policy; providing for the funding of Program
grants from certain fees in the Maryland Strategic Energy Investment Fund;

personal property tax exemption for certain community solar energy generating
system projects; exempting certain nonresidential solar generating systems from the
State or local real or personal property tax; authorizing a county or municipal
corporation to reduce or eliminate an assessment on certain real property on which
a certain solar energy generating system is located; applying certain prevailing wage
requirements for contractors and subcontractors working on certain projects
involving, and traffic control activities related to, any underground gas or electric
infrastructure of an investor–owned gas or electric infrastructure project of the
company; ~~requiring~~ ~~a~~ ~~county~~ ~~to~~ ~~enter~~ ~~into~~ ~~a~~ ~~certain~~ ~~payment~~ ~~in~~ ~~lieu~~ ~~of~~ ~~taxes~~
