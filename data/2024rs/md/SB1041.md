Preamble

WHEREAS, Section 1–201(a)(1)(i) of the Alcoholic Beverages and Cannabis Article
states, in part, that it is the policy of the State to regulate and control the manufacture,
sale, distribution, transportation, and storage of alcoholic beverages in the State for the
purposes of obtaining respect and obedience to the law and to foster and promote
temperance; and

WHEREAS, Section 1–201(b)(1) of the Alcoholic Beverages and Cannabis Article
states that it is the policy of the State to authorize the Office of the Executive Director and
others to displace or limit economic competition by regulating and engaging in the sale or
distribution of alcoholic beverages; and

WHEREAS, Section 1–201(b)(1)(i) through (iv) of the Alcoholic Beverages and

business practices, and promote the general welfare of residents of the State by controlling
the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages; and

WHEREAS, To accomplish and ensure that the State can carry out its duties as
required in the Alcoholic Beverages and Cannabis Article, this Act reaffirms the legitimacy
of the three–tiered system as a means of regulating the alcoholic beverages industry as
stipulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Tennessee Wine and Spirits
Retailers Assn. v. Thomas, 139 S. Ct. 2449 (2019); and

WHEREAS, It is the intent of the General Assembly to limit the issuance of direct
delivery permits by the Office of the Executive Director to licensed Maryland
manufacturers in order to protect public health and provide strong incentives not to sell
alcohol in a way that threatens public health or safety; now, therefore,
