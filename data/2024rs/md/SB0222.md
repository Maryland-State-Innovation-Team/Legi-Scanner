Apprenticeships

FOR the purpose of clarifying that a quorum of the State Board of Environmental Health

completion of an apprenticeship approved by the Board as an alternative to obtaining
experience in an environmental health specialist–in–training program; authorizing
the Board to approve an examination provider to administer the examination, rather
than administering the examination itself; and generally relating to the State Board
of Environmental Health Specialists.
