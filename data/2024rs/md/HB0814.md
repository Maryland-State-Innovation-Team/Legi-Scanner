1. File a petition or a peace order request or both;

2. Refer the complaint to the Department of Juvenile Services

[(iii)] (V) This subsection may not be construed or interpreted to limit

(2) The informal adjustment process may not exceed 90 days unless:

(i) That time is extended by the court; or

(ii) The intake officer determines that additional time is necessary for
the child to participate in a substance–related disorder treatment program or a mental
health program that is part of the informal adjustment process.

(3) If the victim, the child, and the child’s parent or guardian do not consent
to an informal adjustment, the intake officer shall authorize the filing of a petition or a peace
order request or both or deny authorization to file a petition or a peace order request or both
under subsection (g) of this section.

(4) (I) If at any time before the completion of an agreed upon informal
adjustment the intake officer believes that the informal adjustment cannot be completed
successfully, the intake officer shall authorize the filing of a petition or a peace order request
or both or deny authorization to file a petition or a peace order request or both under
subsection (g) of this section.

(II) IF THE INTAKE OFFICER DENIES AUTHORIZATION TO FILE A
PETITION OR A PEACE ORDER REQUEST UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF THIS
PARAGRAPH, THE INTAKE OFFICER SHALL IMMEDIATELY FORWARD TO THE STATE’S
ATTORNEY:

1. THE COMPLAINT; AND

2. A COPY OF THE ENTIRE INTAKE CASE FILE WITH
INFORMATION AS TO ANY PRIOR INTAKE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CHILD.

(g) (1) If based upon the complaint and the inquiry, the intake officer concludes
that the court has no jurisdiction, or that neither an informal adjustment nor judicial action
is appropriate, the intake officer may deny authorization to file a petition or a peace order
request or both.

(2) If the intake officer denies authorization to file a petition or a peace order
request or both, the intake officer shall inform the following persons of the decision, the
reasons for it, and their right of review provided in this section:
