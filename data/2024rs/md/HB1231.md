may not take any action to reduce or alter the boundaries of the oyster sanctuaries
established in “Oyster Sanctuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and its Tidal Tributaries
(September 2010)” until the Department has developed an updated fisheries management

this subsection and determined by the Department in consultation with the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental Science.

(ii) The fishery management plan developed in accordance with
paragraph (5) of this subsection shall:

1. End the overfishing of oysters in all areas and regions of
the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries where overfishing has occurred according to
biological reference points established by the most recent oyster stock assessment while
maintaining a harvest in the fishery;

2. Achieve fishing mortality rates at target levels;

3. Increase oyster abundance;

4. Increase oyster habitat; and

5. Facilitate the long–term sustainable harvest of oysters,
including the public fishery.

(iii) This paragraph may not be construed to prevent the Department
from:

1. Selecting the final two tributaries for tributary–scale
oyster restoration sanctuary projects in accordance with the 2014 Chesapeake Bay
Agreement; or

dimensions for a tributary–scale oyster restoration sanctuary project.]

[(5)] (4) (i) The Department shall:

1. In coordination with the University of Maryland Center
for Environmental Science and the Oyster Advisory Commission, develop a package of
consensus recommendations for enhancing and implementing the fishery management
plan for oysters that will be informed by a collaboratively developed, science–based
modeling tool to quantify the long–term impacts of identified management actions and
possible combinations of management actions on:

A. Oyster abundance;

B. Oyster habitat;

C. Oyster harvest;

D. Oyster harvest revenue; and

management actions to achieve the targets identified in the oyster stock assessment with
the goal of increasing oyster abundance; and

3. Review model results for each management action or
combination of management actions to inform its recommendations.

Government Article, the General Assembly.

2. In addition to the requirements under subsubparagraph 1
of this subparagraph, the Department shall include in the interim report submitted by
August 1, 2021:

modeling tool used to quantify the long–term impacts of identified management actions;
and

B. A summary of the model results of any actions identified
by the Oyster Advisory Commission on or before the date of the interim report.

3. The Department shall provide a final report by December
