Preamble

WHEREAS, Following extensive research and the issuance of a report by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency that clearly demonstrated the alarming extent of
degradation of the Chesapeake Bay, in significant part because of prominent land use and
growth patterns, the Critical Area Commission was created in 1984 in order to preserve
and restore water quality in the State, to maintain valued wildlife habitat, and to
accommodate inevitable growth, and these same legislative concerns were addressed in
2002 when the protections of the Critical Area Program were expanded to include the
Atlantic Coastal Bays and in 2008 with the comprehensive update to the Critical Area
Program; and

WHEREAS, The critical area, which comprises approximately 11% of Maryland’s
land mass, includes the majority of the State’s most ecologically fragile and valuable
properties; and

WHEREAS, From its inception, partnership between State and local government
has been a cornerstone of the Critical Area Program; and

– 2 –

PAGE 3
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 424

WHEREAS, To date local critical area programs are operative in Baltimore City, 16
counties, and 47 other municipalities, and critical area issues directly impact at least seven
State departments; and

WHEREAS, After nearly 40 years of operation, the Critical Area Program has
effectively influenced thousands of land use decisions, addressed and minimized the
adverse impacts of growth associated with hundreds of requests for growth allocation, and
represented a comprehensive effort between the State and local governments to enforce a
variety of water quality and habitat protection standards; and

WHEREAS, Despite these efforts, additional measures are necessary to enhance a
cooperative land use and natural resource management program that will restore the
quality and productivity of the Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic Coastal Bays, their tidal
tributaries, and associated land–based ecosystems; and

WHEREAS, As a member of the Maryland Commission on Climate Change, the
Critical Area Commission is charged with recommending short and long–term strategies
and initiatives to better mitigate, prepare for, and adapt to the consequences of climate
change; and

WHEREAS, Particularly in light of the ongoing, accelerating decline of the State’s
water quality resources and the loss of valuable shoreline areas due to erosion, sea level
rise, and climate change, the Critical Area Commission has a significant role in ensuring
the adaptation of Maryland’s tidal waters, developed shorelines, and their adjacent
resource lands and wildlife habitats to the rapidly evolving climate realities; and

WHEREAS, To address the increasing effects on water quality from more frequent
and higher–intensity storms, to adjust conservation programs and techniques to the
shifting realities of species and habitats, and to accommodate appropriate levels and
locations for growth within the critical area, improvements to the Critical Area Program
are in order at this time; and

WHEREAS, It is in the interest of the citizens of Maryland that the Critical Area
Commission ensure the equitable distribution of the environmental benefits and burdens
of development, restoration, and mitigation within the critical area and, in doing so, the
Commission must also ensure equitable representation and participation in its processes;
now, therefore,

Article – Natural Resources

8–1801.

(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:

(1) The Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries
are natural resources of great significance to the State and the nation, and their beauty,
their ecological value, and their economic impact all reach far beyond any one local
jurisdiction;

(2) The shoreline and adjacent lands, particularly the buffer areas,
constitute a valuable, fragile, and sensitive part of this estuarine system, where human
activity can have a particularly immediate and adverse impact on water quality and
natural habitats;

– 5 –

PAGE 6
Ch. 424 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(3) The capacity of these shoreline and adjacent lands to withstand
demands, CHANGE,continuing without further degradation toINCLUDING CLIMATE
water quality and natural habitats is limited;

(4) Human activity is harmful in these shoreline areas, where the new
development of nonwater–dependent structures or an increase in lot coverageAND USES
is presumed to be contrary to the purpose of this subtitle, because these activities may
cause adverse impacts, of both an immediate and a long–term nature, to theOR AMPLIFY
~~[wherever~~ ~~possible]~~Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays, and thus it is necessary to
maintain a buffer of at least 100 feet landward from the mean high water line of tidal
waters, tributary streams, and tidal wetlands;

(5) National studies have documented that the quality and productivity of
the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries have declined due to the cumulative
effects of human activity that have caused increased levels of pollutants, nutrients, and
toxics in the Bay system and declines in more protective land uses such as forestland and
agricultural land in the Bay region;

(6) Those portions of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and
their tributaries within Maryland are particularly stressed by the continuing population
growth and development activity concentrated in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan
corridor and along the Atlantic Coast;

(7) The quality of life for the citizens of Maryland is enhanced through the
restoration of the quality and productivity of the waters of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic
Bays[,]Coastal and their tributaries IN A MANNER IN WHICH BURDENS AND BENEFITS
EQUITABLY;ARE DISTRIBUTED

(8) The restoration of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and
their tributaries is dependent, in part, on minimizing further adverse impacts to the water
quality and natural habitats of the shoreline and adjacent lands, AND ENHANCING THE
CRITICAL AREA, particularly in the~~RESILIENCY~~ ~~OF~~ NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE
buffer;

(9) The cumulative impact of current development and of each new
development activity in the buffer is inimical to these purposes, and it is therefore
imperative that State law protect irreplaceable State buffer resources from unpermitted
[and]activity;

(10) There is a critical and substantial State interest for the benefit of
current and future generations in fostering more sensitive development and more effective
enforcement in a consistent and uniform manner along shoreline areas of the Chesapeake
and the Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries so as to minimize damage to water
habitats;quality and natural

(b) It is the purpose of the General Assembly in enacting this subtitle:

(1) To establish a Resource Protection Program for the Chesapeake and the
Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries by fostering more sensitive development
activity for certain shoreline areas so as to minimize damage to water quality and natural
habitats; and

(2) To implement the Resource Protection Program on a cooperative basis
