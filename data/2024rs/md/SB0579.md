PAGE 7
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 191

(2) While Maryland has made significant progress in providing meals to all
students through a variety of programs, this has led to a patchwork approach across the
State.

(b) On or before December 1, 2024, the State Department of Education shall
report to the General Assembly, in accordance with § 2–1257 of the State Government
Article, on the cost to provide free breakfast and lunch to all students in public schools in
the State.

~~(b)~~ (c) In determining the cost estimate for the report required under subsection ~~(a)~~
(b) of this section, the Department shall consider:

(1) for each county, the current rate of providing free breakfast and lunch
through programs including:

(i) Maryland Meals for Achievement; and

(ii) participation in the United States Department of Agriculture
Community Eligibility Program; and

(2) for each county, including data disaggregated by elementary, middle,
and high school, and by breakfast and lunch:

(i) the participation rates in the school meals program;

(ii) the student cost for meals;

(iii) subsidies provided to students to assist in the cost of meals;

(iv) school attendance rates;

(v) the staffing costs of providing meals on a per pupil basis; and

(vi) the thresholds for participation in the Community Eligibility
Provisions.

(d) In addition, the Department shall compile research completed in other states
that have established universal meal programs and prepare a summary of any findings
presented in those reports as part of its report under subsection (b) of this section.

SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect July
1, 2024. It shall remain effective for a period of 1 year and, at the end of June 30, 2025, this
Act, with no further action required by the General Assembly, shall be abrogated and of no
further force and effect.

Approved by the Governor, April 25, 2024.
