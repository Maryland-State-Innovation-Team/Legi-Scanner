one or more drugs and alcohol that the person cannot operate a vessel safely; or

evidentiary presumptions and procedures established under §§ 10–302 through 10–309 of
the Courts Article are applicable to any violation of this section.

(2) If at the time of testing an individual has an alcohol concentration that
meets the definition of “under the influence of alcohol per se” in § 11–174.1 of the
Transportation Article, as determined by an analysis of the individual’s blood or breath, it
shall be prima facie evidence that the individual was operating a vessel while under the
influence of alcohol.

(3) Any person who operates or attempts to operate a vessel on the waters
of the State is deemed to have consented, subject to §§ 10–302 through 10–309 of the Courts
Article, to take a test, as defined in § 16–205.1 of the Transportation Article, if the person
is detained by a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has
been operating or attempting to operate a vessel while under the influence of alcohol, while
impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a
combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not operate the vessel
safely, or while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance.

compelled to take a test, as defined in § 16–205.1 of the Transportation Article.

take a test that, on receipt of a sworn statement from the officer that the person was
requested to take a test and refused or was tested and the result indicated an alcohol
concentration of 0.08 or more, the court may, on conviction and in addition to other
penalties, prohibit the person from operating a vessel on the waters of the State for up to 1
year.

(d) It is not a defense to a charge of violating subsection (a)(3) of this section that
the person charged is or was entitled under the laws of this State to use the drug,
combination of drugs, or combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, unless the person
was unaware that the drug or combination would make the person incapable of safely
operating a vessel.
