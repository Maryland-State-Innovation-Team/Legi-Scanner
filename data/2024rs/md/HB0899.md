Preamble

WHEREAS, The lives and property of Maryland residents and businesses are all
protected by and benefit greatly from strong and efficient fire, rescue, and emergency
medical services response systems, coordinated at the county and community level across
Maryland; and

WHEREAS, The social and demographic makeup of communities has largely shifted,
presenting both career and volunteer fire companies and emergency medical services great
difficulty in recruiting and retaining individuals for service; and
– 1 –

Ch. 223 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

WHEREAS, Appropriate educational attainment in the fire and emergency medical
service in either a career or volunteer capacity is important but also creates a meaningful
barrier to new entrants into any fire fighting or emergency medical service capacity; and

WHEREAS, A stark shortage of available recruits and on–duty firefighters and
emergency medical services personnel has caused fire companies to call on volunteers who
are well into their 60s and 70s for primary response to fire and emergency medical calls;
and

WHEREAS, Volunteer fire companies remain deeply embedded in many
communities, serving as the primary fire fighting and emergency medical response across
large parts of the State; and

WHEREAS, Relatively metropolitan parts of the State rely on coordinated services
from both career and volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel to
provide needed service coverage, but face strains in finding adequate participation at both
levels; and

WHEREAS, Maryland and its local governments currently offer a variety of support
incentives, staff benefits, and other compensation targeted to career and volunteer fire
company members and those working in emergency medical services; and

WHEREAS, The recruitment and retention of both career and volunteer firefighters
and emergency medical services personnel pose an urgent and high priority concern for
Marylanders’ safety and security in the short term and long term; and

WHEREAS, the Maryland General Assembly, through Chapter 655 of the Acts of the
General Assembly of 2023, created the Commission to Advance and Strengthen Fire
Fighting and Emergency Medical Services Within Maryland to develop a set of
recommendations to strengthen the State’s fire fighting and emergency medical services;
now, therefore,
