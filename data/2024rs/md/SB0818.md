Preamble

WHEREAS, Artificial intelligence is transforming society and work, and the pace of
that change will present new opportunities and risks for the State’s residents, workers, and
economy; and

WHEREAS, The State must ensure the responsible, ethical, beneficial, and
trustworthy use of artificial intelligence in State government; and

WHEREAS, The State is home to a rich and growing artificial intelligence ecosystem
of academic, industry, government, and civil society experts, researchers, builders,
organizers, and stakeholders; and

WHEREAS, To foster an environment for innovation while respecting individuals,
employees, and civil rights, as artificial intelligence technologies are developed and evolve,
the technologies should be analyzed and monitored by government officials, industry
experts, consumer protection advocates, and other stakeholders; and

WHEREAS, Given the rapid rate of change in artificial intelligence technologies and
industry, the State must chart a principled yet adaptable, pragmatic path forward, so that
the technologies’ benefits can be confidently harnessed on behalf of Marylanders and in
service of the Governor’s mission to Leave No One Behind; and

WHEREAS, Leaders across State government share a common interest in
establishing effective artificial intelligence governance and are committed to working
together to develop the legal and policy framework for its responsible use in the State; and

WHEREAS, Automated systems should be safe and effective, developed with
consultation from diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts to identify
concerns, risks, and potential impacts of the systems; and

WHEREAS, Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should take
proactive and continuous measures to protect individuals and communities from
algorithmic discrimination and to use and design systems in an equitable way; and

WHEREAS, Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should seek
permission and respect decisions regarding collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of
data in appropriate ways and to the greatest extent possible; where not possible, alternative
privacy by design safeguards should be used; and

WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 496

WHEREAS, Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should
provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of
the overall system functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are
in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of
outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible; and

WHEREAS, Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should
consider the specific types of actions for which a human alternative is appropriate,
commensurate with the magnitude of the action and risk of harm, along with the extent to
which a human alternative would be beneficial to individuals and the public interest; now,
therefore,
