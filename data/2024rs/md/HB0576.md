Ch. 703 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

Preamble

WHEREAS, A seamless behavioral health continuum of care that provides access to
high quality, equitable behavioral health care is necessary for the further development of
mental health services in Maryland; and

WHEREAS, Allowing for more options to serve individuals in crisis will help further
strengthen Maryland’s crisis response system and better serve individuals in crisis; and

WHEREAS, Intensive outpatient services, such as assisted outpatient treatment,
function to reduce homelessness, needless hospitalizations, arrests, and incarcerations; and

WHEREAS, A small but persistent subset of individuals with severe mental illness
struggle to engage voluntarily in treatment necessary to live safely in the community, in
many cases due to an inability through no fault of their own to maintain awareness or
understanding of their mental illness; and

WHEREAS, When individuals with severe mental illness remain untreated, they
suffer needlessly from homelessness, poverty, repeated hospitalizations, repeated arrests,
trauma, and suicide; and

WHEREAS, Civil commitment to outpatient care combined with adequate resources
for treatment and monitoring, known in many states as “assisted outpatient treatment”, is
a federally recognized best practice for improving treatment adherence and outcomes
among individuals with histories of repeated psychiatric crises while reducing systemic
costs through avoided hospitalization; and

WHEREAS, Maryland is one of only three remaining states without statutory
authority for a civil court to order an individual to adhere to outpatient care; now, therefore,

SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:

~~Article~~ ~~–~~ ~~Health~~ ~~–~~ ~~General~~
