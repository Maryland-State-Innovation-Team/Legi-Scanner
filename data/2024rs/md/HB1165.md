SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:

Article – Agriculture

2–505.

(a) The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund is created and continued

(1) THE purposes specified in this subtitle; AND

(2) ACCELERATING THE RESTORATION OF THE CHESAPEAKE BAY

NATURAL RESOURCES ARTICLE, INCLUDING FOR PROJECTS THAT OCCUR ON LAND
SUBJECT TO AN AGRICULTURAL LAND PRESERVATION EASEMENT.

8–702.

(a) (1) The General Assembly finds and declares that agriculturally related
nonpoint sources of water pollution may potentially contribute to the degradation of the
water resources of this State and that prevention and control efforts have been hampered
because of the cost and lack of income producing potential in many agricultural practices
designed to protect water quality.

(2) To assist in the implementation of agricultural practices which
minimize water pollution from erosion, animal wastes, nutrients, and agricultural
chemicals AND TO ADDRESS THE WATER POLLUTION IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURE, a
cost sharing program between the State and eligible applicants is established for the public
benefit.

8–704.

(a) (1) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (2) OF THIS SUBSECTION,
State cost–sharing funds for a project being considered for State cost–sharing may be made
available:

[(1)] (I) For up to 100% of eligible costs, not to exceed a dollar amount of
up to $200,000 as determined by a regulation adopted jointly by the Secretary of
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Environment; and

[(2)] (II) If:

[(i)] 1. The Department of Agriculture, the soil conservation
district, and a person have executed an agreement which, among other things, obligates
the person to:

[1.] A. Establish, construct, or install the best
management practice or fixed natural filter practice in accordance with technical
specifications;

[2.] B. Maintain the best management practice or fixed
natural filter practice for its expected life span; and

[3.] C. Provide the required matching funds, if any, for the
project;

[(ii)] 2. The Board of Public Works has given approval to the
project when the proceeds of State bonds are to be used to finance the State share; and

(2) CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION, STATE
COST–SHARING FUNDS MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO FUND THE WHOLE WATERSHED
FUND ESTABLISHED UNDER § 8–2B–03 OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES ARTICLE.

(3) A reduction in State cost–sharing rates for riparian forest buffers,
riparian herbaceous cover, wetland restoration, or pasture management may not be based
on tons of soil saved or an amortization formula.

(4) State cost–sharing rates for pasture management shall be based on the
applicable rate established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Environmental Quality
Incentives Program.

(5) State cost–sharing rates paid for the planting of multiple species of
cover crops shall equal or exceed the rates paid for the planting of a single species of cover
crop.

(6) (i) 1. Except as authorized under subsubparagraph 2 of this
subparagraph and before the Department of Agriculture executes a cost–sharing
agreement with a farm tenant, it shall obtain the consent of the landlord to the terms and
conditions of the agreement.

2. The Department may execute the agreement without the
consent of the landlord if:

A. The agreement concerns a short–term project that
involves only the planting of a cover crop; and

B. The Department has sent by first–class mail written
notice of a cover crop project to the landlord at least 10 calendar days before executing the
agreement for the first cover crop project during the term of the lease.

(ii) The Department may also require the granting to the State of an
appropriate security interest in any equipment, structures or similar items purchased with
State money.

(7) A cost–sharing agreement executed as required under this subtitle may
be assigned and transferred to a successor in title of all or part of a tract of land subject to
a best management practice.
