Annotated Code of Maryland
(2013 Replacement Volume and 2023 Supplement)

Preamble

WHEREAS, The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes
that children need special safeguards and care in all aspects of their lives, specifying how
children’s rights apply in the digital environment in General Comment No. 25; and

WHEREAS, As children spend more of their time interacting with the online world,
the impact of the design of online products on their well–being has become a focus of
significant concern; and

Ch. 461 2024 LAWS OF MARYLAND

WHEREAS, There is widespread agreement at the international level, and
bipartisan agreement in the United States, that more needs to be done to create a safer
online space for children to learn, explore, and play; and

WHEREAS, Lawmakers around the globe have taken steps to enhance privacy
protections for children based on the understanding that, in relation to data protection,
greater privacy necessarily means greater security and well–being; and

WHEREAS, Children should be afforded protections not only by online products and
services specifically directed at them, but by all online products they are likely to access,
and thus covered entities should take into account the unique needs of different age ranges,
including the following developmental stages: 0 to 5 years of age, or “preliterate and early
literacy”; 6 to 9 years of age, or “core primary school years”; 10 to 12 years of age, or
“transition years”; 13 to 15 years of age, or “early teens”; and 16 to 17 years of age, or
“approaching adulthood”; and

WHEREAS, While it is clear that the same data protection regime may not be
appropriate for children of all ages, children of all ages should nonetheless be afforded
privacy and protection, and online products should adopt data protection regimes
appropriate for children of the ages likely to access those products; and

WHEREAS, According to the Pew Research Center, in 2022, 97% of American
teenagers aged 13–17 used the Internet every day, with 46% responding they used the
Internet almost constantly; and, additionally, 36% of teens reported being concerned about
their social media use, while an earlier Pew Research Center study found that 59% of teens
have been bullied or harassed online; and

WHEREAS, The findings of the Pew Research Center are not surprising, given what
is known about controllers’ use of personal data and how it is utilized to inform
manipulative practices, to which children are particularly vulnerable; and

WHEREAS, Online products that are likely to be accessed by children should offer
strong privacy protections that, by design, prevent the use of children’s personal data to
offer elements that the covered entity offering the online product knows, or has reason to
know, are likely to be materially detrimental to the physical health, mental health, or
well–being of children; and

WHEREAS, Ensuring robust privacy, and thus safety, protections for children by
design is consistent with federal safety laws and policies applied to children’s products,
regulating everything from toys to clothing to furniture and games; and

WHEREAS, The consumer protections that federal safety laws apply to children’s
products require these products to comply with certain safety standards by their very
design, so that harms to children, and in some cases other consumers, are prevented; and

WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 461

WHEREAS, It is the intent of the Maryland General Assembly that the Maryland
Age–Appropriate Design Code Act promote innovation by covered entities whose online
products are likely to be accessed by children by ensuring that those online products are
designed in a manner that recognizes the distinct needs of children within different age
ranges; ~~and~~ now, therefore,

~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~It~~ ~~is~~ ~~the~~ ~~intent~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~Maryland~~ ~~General~~ ~~Assembly~~ ~~that~~ ~~covered~~ ~~entities~~
