someone holding under the tenant, who shall unlawfully hold over beyond the expiration of 19 
2 SENATE BILL 32   
 
 the lease or termination of the tenancy, shall be liable to the landlord for the actual 1 
damages caused by the holding over.  2 
 
  (2) The damages awarded to a landlord against the tenant or someone 3 
holding under the tenant, may not be less than the apportioned rent for the period of 4 
holdover at the rate under the lease.  5 
 
  (3) (i) Any action to recover damages under this section may be brought 6 
by suit separate from the eviction or removal proceeding or in the same action and in any 7 
court having jurisdiction over the amount in issue.  8 
 
   (ii) The court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the 9 
damages determined to be due together with cost s of the suit if the court finds that the 10 
residential tenant was personally served with a summons, or, in the case of a nonresidential 11 
tenancy, there was such service of process or submission to the jurisdiction of the court as 12 
would support a judgment in contract or tort.  13 
 
   (iii) A nonresidential tenant who was not personally served with a 14 
summons shall not be subject to personal jurisdiction of the court if that tenant asserts that 15 
the appearance is for the purpose of defending an in rem action prior to  the time that 16 
evidence is taken by the court.  17 
 
  (4) Nothing [contained herein ] IN THIS SECTION  is intended to limit any 18 
other remedies which a landlord may have against a holdover tenant under the lease or 19 
under applicable law.  20
