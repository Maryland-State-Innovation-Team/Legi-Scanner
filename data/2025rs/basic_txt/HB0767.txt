Preamble  11 
 
 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity 12 
to reclaim their personal belongings after  of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity 13 
and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confronta tions on eviction; 14 
and 15 
 
 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal 16 
belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and  17 
 
 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal be longings 18 
safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community;  now, therefore,  19
