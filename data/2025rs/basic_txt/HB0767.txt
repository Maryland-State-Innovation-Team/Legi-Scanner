Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity 
to reclaim their personal belongings after  of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity 
and huma n rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal 
belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings 
safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community;  now, therefore,
