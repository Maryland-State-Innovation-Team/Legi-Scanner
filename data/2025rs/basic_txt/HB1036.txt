FOR the purpose of altering the factors the Public Service Commission must consider before 4 
taking final action on a certificate of public convenience and necessity; establishing 5 
a distributed generation certificate of public convenience and necessity to au thorize 6 
the construction and operation of a certain distributed solar energy generating 7 
system; requiring the Power Plant Research Program, by a certain date, to develop 8 
and submit to the Commission proposed siting and design requirements and 9 
licensing con ditions;  establishing certain requirements for the construction of a 10 
certain solar energy generating station or front –of–the–meter  energy storage device; 11 
prohibiting a local jurisdiction from adopting certain laws or regulations or denying 12 
certain site dev elopment plans under certain circumstances; requiring a local 13 
government to expedite the review and approval of certain site development plans 14 
under certain circumstances; authorizing a local government to establish a certain 15 
community solar energy generat ing system automatic enrollment program under 16 
certain circumstances;  establishing certain requirements for the sale, lease, and 17 
installation of certain residential rooftop solar energy generating systems; requiring 18 
the Maryland Department of Labor to develop a special solar contractor license;  19 
requiring the Commission to conduct a certain study to establish a process by which 20
