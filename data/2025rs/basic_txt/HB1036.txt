Public Utilities – Generating Stations – Generation and Siting  
(Renewable Energy Certainty Act)  
 
FOR the purpose of altering the factors the Public Service Commission must consider before 
taking final action on a certificate of public convenience and necessity; establishing 
a distributed generation certificate of public convenience and necessity to au thorize 
the construction and operation of a certain distributed solar energy generating 
system; requiring the Power Plant Research Program, by a certain date, to develop 
and submit to the Commission proposed siting and design requirements and 
licensing con ditions;  establishing certain requirements for the construction of a 
certain solar energy generating station or front –of–the–meter  energy storage device; 
prohibiting a local jurisdiction from adopting certain laws or regulations or denying 
certain site dev elopment plans under certain circumstances; requiring a local 
government to expedite the review and approval of certain site development plans 
under certain circumstances; authorizing a local government to establish a certain 
community solar energy generat ing system automatic enrollment program under 
certain circumstances;  establishing certain requirements for the sale, lease, and 
installation of certain residential rooftop solar energy generating systems; requiring 
the Maryland Department of Labor to develop a special solar contractor license;  
requiring the Commission to conduct a certain study to establish a process by which 
the Commission may establish certain partnerships  procurement models ; and
