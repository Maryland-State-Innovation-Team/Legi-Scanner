 (b) The State recognizes the need to dispose of these chemical warfare materials 13 
as safely as possible, ensuring the health and safety of State residents by the regulation of 14 
their release into the environment.  15 
 
 (c) Since these chemical warfare materials are highly toxic or carcinogenic, in 16 
addition to any other applicable requirements at law, the State shall require [without 17 
exemption or waiver ] that an applicant for the treatment by incineration of chemical 18 
warfare mate rials shall comply with all [the] APPLICABLE  requirements of this subtitle 19 
and all APPLICABLE  regulations adopted under this subtitle.  20 
 
 (D) NOTHING IN THIS SECTI ON OR IN §§ 7–239.3  AND 7–239.4  THROUGH  21

  (2) In addition to any other applicable requirements, the Department may 3 
not issue a per mit for the construction, material alteration, or operation of a controlled 4 
hazardous substance facility to be used for the treatment by incineration of a chemical 5 
warfare material unless:  6 
 
  (1) (I) The permit applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of  the 7 
Department prior to issuance of a controlled hazardous substance facility permit:  8 
 
   (i) 1. That the proposed incinerator technology has consistently 9 
met all applicable federal and State performance standards in an operational facility 10 
comparable to the proposed facility for a period of time and under conditions acceptable to 11 
the Department;  12 
 
   (ii) 2. That emissions and monitoring data from a comparable 13 
facility demonstrate compliance with State toxic air pollutant standards established under 14

   (v) 5. That an emergency preparedness plan has been develo ped 22 
with adequate public participation that provides training, coordination, and equipment 23

respond to a release of a chemical warfare material from the proposed facility; a nd 25 
 
   (vi) 6. That the emergency preparedness plan has been 26 
presented at public meetings in each county potentially impacted by a worst –case release;  27 
 
  (2) (II) The Department finds that the applicant has fully evaluated all 28 
reasonable alternative method s for treatment or disposal including transport to a less 29 
populated disposal site in order to create less risk of release or harm to the general public 30
