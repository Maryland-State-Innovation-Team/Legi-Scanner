Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection Commission – Established  2 
 
FOR the purpose of establishing the Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection 3 
Commission to monitor and assess the impact of potential and actual federal changes 4 
to specified health care programs and to provide recommendations for State and local 5 
action to protect the access of residents of the State to affordable health coverage; 6 
and generally relating to the Maryland Health In surance Coverage Protection 7 
Commission.  8 
 
Preamble  9 
 
 WHEREAS, The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has 10 
enabled more than 600,000 Maryland residents to gain access to quality and affordable 11 
2 HOUSE BILL 718   
 
 health insurance coverage since its implementation, with the State’s uninsured rate 1 
dropping from approximately 11% in 2010 to approximately 6% in 2024; and  2 
 
 WHEREAS, Approximately 6% of Maryland residents remain uninsured, with 3 
disparities in coverage rates particularly affecting communiti es of color and low –income 4 
households; and  5 
 
 WHEREAS, Changes to the ACA, the federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction 6 
Equity Act (MHPAEA),  Medicaid, or Medicare could significantly impact health care access 7 
and affordability for Maryland residents; and  8 
 
 WHEREAS, It is estimated that a repeal of the ACA may result in over 30 million 9 
individuals becoming uninsured in the United States; and  10 
 
 WHEREAS, In Maryland, more than 600,000 people may become uninsured in the 11 
aftermath of a repeal of the ACA; and  12 
 
 WHEREAS, Millions of American seniors, including thousands of Maryland seniors, 13 
could incur substantially higher health care costs following a repeal or weakening of the 14 
ACA or Medicare; and  15 
 
 WHEREAS, Recent federal policy changes and market dynamics have  created 16 
uncertainty in the health care landscape, potentially affecting the stability of Maryland’s 17 
insurance markets and health care delivery systems; and  18 
 
 WHEREAS, The COVID –19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of 19 
maintaining robust health c are infrastructure and ensuring widespread access to 20 
affordable health coverage; and  21 
 
 WHEREAS, It is prudent for Maryland to monitor and mitigate these negative 22 
effects of a repeal or weakening of the ACA, MHPAEA,  Medicaid, or Medicare and to protect 23 
public health by recommending and implementing solutions in the event of a broad –scale 24 
loss of health coverage; now, therefore,  25
