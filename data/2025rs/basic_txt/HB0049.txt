and reporting for Building Energy Pe rformance Standards  altering the requirements 
for certain regulations adopted by the Department of the Environment relating to 
building energy performance standards to include certain crediting,  exclusions, and 
considerations, a certain alternative complia nce pathway fee for energy use 
attributable to a building’s failure to meet energy use intensity targets, certain 
waivers from certain alternative compliance pathway fees, and a certain annual 
reporting fee to cover certain costs; requiring the Department to offer certain 
training to help certain energy auditors understand the requirements under the 
building energy performance standards and publish a list of energy auditors that 
have completed the training  and a certain annual reporting fee to cover certain  costs ;
