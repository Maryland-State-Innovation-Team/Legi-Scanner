 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the net proceeds of the sale 30 
of bonds shall be used and applied exclusively and solely for the acquisition, construction, 31

amounts borrowed shall prove inadequate to finance the projects described in the 33 
resolution, the Cou nty may issue additional bonds with the limitations hereof for the 34 
purpose of evidencing the borrowing of additional funds for such financing, provided the 35 
resolution authorizing the sale of additional bonds shall so recite, but if the net proceeds of 36 
the sale of any issue of bonds exceed the amount needed to finance the projects described 37 
in the resolution, the excess funds so borrowed and not expended shall be applied to the 38 
payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or to the redemption of any p art of the 39 
bonds which have been made redeemable or to the purchase and cancellation of bonds, 40

shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit 2

taxes upon all the a ssessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and 6 
amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and 7

improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act and, to the extent 15

authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the 19 
manner hereinabove described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or 20

refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity 22 
of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of 23 
bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be 24 
issued by the County in such an amount as shall be necessary for the purpose of providing 25

purpose of providing it with funds to purchase in the open market any of its outstanding 27 
bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity thereof, or for the purpose of providing it 28 
with funds for the redemption prior to maturity of any outstanding  bonds issued hereunder 29

any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times 4 
exempt from State, county, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature 5 
whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County  6 
from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable 7 
from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  8 
 
 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow 9 
money and issue bonds conferred on the County b y this Act shall be deemed to provide an 10 
additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as 11 
supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall 12 
not be regarded as in derogation of any power  now existing; and all Acts of the General 13 
Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are 14 
hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been 15 
exercised, and nothing contained in this Act ma y be construed to impair, in any way, the 16 
validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any 17 
said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This 18 
Act, being necessary for the welfa re of the inhabitants of St. Mary’s County, shall be 19 
liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent 20
