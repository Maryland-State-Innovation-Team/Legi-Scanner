Preamble  3 
 
 WHEREAS, Local governments in Maryland must have authority from the 4 
Maryland General Assembly in order to impose a development impact fee or an excise tax; 5 
and 6 
 
 WHEREAS, Code home rule counties are authorized collectively to impose specified 7 
development impact fee s and excise taxes, and many counties have specific authorizations 8 
from the Maryland General Assembly; and  9 
 
 WHEREAS, Title 20, Subtitle 7 of the Local Government Article provides for the 10 
specific uses of revenues received from development impact fees; and  11 
 
 WHEREAS, County Commissioners of code counties may impose development 12 
impact fees by public local law to finance any of the capital costs of additional or expanded 13 
public works improvements, and facilities required to accommodate new construction or 14 
development; and  15 
 
 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of the United States, in Sheetz v. County of El 16 
Dorado, 601 U.S. ____ (2024), held that local government permit conditions (1) must have 17 
an “essential nexus” to the government’s land use interests, and “rough prop ortionality” to 18 
the development’s impact on the land use interest; and (2) may not require a landowner to 19 
give up or pay more than is necessary to mitigate harms caused from new development; 20 
now, therefore,  21
