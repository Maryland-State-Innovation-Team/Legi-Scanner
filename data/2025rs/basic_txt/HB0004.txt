AN ACT concerning  
 
Restrictions on Use – Solar Collector Systems – Alteration  
 
FOR the purpose of prohibiting a restriction on use regarding land use that increases the 
cost of installing a solar collector system by at least a certain percentage over a 
certain cost or that reduces the efficiency of the solar collector system by at least a 
certain percentage under a certain level of energy generation; au thorizing a 
community association to prohibit the installation of a solar collector system in the 
common area or common elements within the real estate development served by the 
community association; authorizing a community association to impose reasonabl e 
restrictions on the installation of a solar collector system in the common area or 
common elements; authorizing a community association to install a solar collector

hours of the day on specified dates when direct sunlight to a specified surface of a solar 
collector system may not be obstructed;  
 
   (ii) The restrictions placed on vegetation, structures, and other 
objects that would impair the passage of sunli ght through the solar easement; and
