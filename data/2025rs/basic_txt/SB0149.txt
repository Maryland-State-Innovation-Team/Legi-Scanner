Preamble  23 
 
 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, 24 
is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and  25 
 
 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the 26 
State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate ch ange that are 27 
irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, 28 
flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and  29 
 
 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of 30 
climate  change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new 31 
or upgraded infrastructure; and  32 
 
 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette 33 
Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited b y harming the public 34 
welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and  35 
 
 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great 36 
accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by speci fic fossil fuel 37
