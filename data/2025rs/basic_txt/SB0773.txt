 Article – Insurance  
Section 15 –118.1 and 15 –1611.3  
 Annotated Code of Maryland  
 (2017 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)  
 
Preamble  
 
 WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with 
rare, serious, and  chronic diseases afford out –of–pocket costs for their essential and often 
life–saving medications; and  
 
Ch. 692  2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND   
 
– 2 –  WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out –of–pocket 
costs for their prescription medications; and  
 
 WHEREAS, When patient s face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan 
year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential 
negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits, 
surgeries, and other interventions; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met 
requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s inclusion on the  
patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and 
step therapy; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented 
programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restrict cost sharing assistance 
from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out –of–pocket limit; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to 
continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual out –of–pocket limit, 
forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out –of–pocket limit twice and denying 
them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to 
access their life –saving medication; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Patients often  are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment 
programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs 
when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run 
out, whether at the p harmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and  
 
 WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy 
benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance 
program and the patie nt, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual  
out–of–pocket limit; and  
 
 WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy 
benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the patient by  
another person toward the patient’s annual out –of–pocket limit and any cost sharing 
requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,
