Section 15 –118.1 and 15 –1611.3  16 
 Annotated Code of Maryland  17 
 (2017 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)  18 
 
Preamble  19 
 
 WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with 20 
rare, serio us, and chronic diseases afford out –of–pocket costs for their essential and often 21 
life–saving medications; and  22 
 
 WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out –of–pocket 23 
costs for their prescription medications; and  24 
 
 WHEREAS, When patients face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan 25 
year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and  26 
 
 WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential 27 
negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits, 28 
surgeries, and other interventions; and  29 
 
 WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met 30 
requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s incl usion on the 31 
patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and 32 
step therapy; and  33 
 
 WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented 34 
programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restri ct cost sharing assistance 35 
from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out –of–pocket limit; and  36 
 
 WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to 37 
continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual ou t–of–pocket limit, 38 
 SENATE BILL 773  3 
 
 forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out –of–pocket limit twice and denying 1 
them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to 2 
access their life –saving medication; and  3 
 
 WHEREAS, Patien ts often are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment 4 
programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs 5 
when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run 6 
out, whether at the pharmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and  7 
 
 WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy 8 
benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance 9 
program and t he patient, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual  10 
out–of–pocket limit; and  11 
 
 WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy 12 
benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the pa tient by 13 
another person toward the patient’s annual out –of–pocket limit and any cost sharing 14 
requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,  15
