Preamble  29 
 
 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, 30 
is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and  31 
 
 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gase s, the 32 
State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are 33 
irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, 34 
flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and  35 
 
 WHEREAS , Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of 36 
climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new 37 
or upgraded infrastructure; and  38 
4 HOUSE BILL 128   
 
  
 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Ci garette 1 
Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public 2 
welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and  3 
 
 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great 4 
accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel 5 
companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require 6 
compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time 7 
period; now, therefore,  8
