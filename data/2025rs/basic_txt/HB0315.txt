AN ACT concerning  1 
 
Task Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in Maryland  2 
 
FOR the purpose of establishing the Task Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in 3 
Maryland to examine and analyze the efficiency, uniformity, and quality of fiduciary 4 
adjudication in Maryland and make recommendations; requiring the orphans’ 5 
courts, circuit  courts, registers of wills, and Administrative Office of the Courts to 6 
comply with certain requests of the Task Force;  and generally relating to the Task 7 
Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in Maryland.  8 
 
Preamble  9 
 
 WHEREAS, In 2022, the Task Force to Study the Maryland Orphans’ Courts issued 10 
a report identifying certain inefficiencies and other problems with the selection of judges 11 
for, and adjudication of matters before, the orphans’ courts; and  12 
 
2 HOUSE BILL 315   
 
  WHEREAS, More recent developments have further illustr ated those problems, 1 
including the lack of uniformity in probate adjudication across Maryland’s jurisdictions; 2 
and 3 
 
 WHEREAS, The adjudication of other fiduciary matters, including those relating to 4 
trusts and adult guardianships, involve overlapping issue s with probate matters and can 5 
be more efficient; and  6 
 
 WHEREAS, Maryland created the orphans’ courts in 1777 in order to assist families 7 
with the transmission of wealth on a member’s death; and  8 
 
 WHEREAS, In the ensuing 248 years, methods for holding and transmitting wealth 9 
have changed significantly, and probate and fiduciary legal issues have become 10 
substantially more complex; and  11 
 
 WHEREAS, The General Assembly recognizes the value that a specialized court 12 
brings to families in times of transition; and  13 
 
 WHEREAS, The General Assembly also recognizes the need for further changes to 14 
fiduciary adjudication in Maryland in order to provide a uniform and efficient system for 15 
its citizens; now, therefore,  16
