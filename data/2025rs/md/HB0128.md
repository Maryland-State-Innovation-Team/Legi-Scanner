29 Preamble

30 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
31 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and

32 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
33 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
34 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
35 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and

36 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
37 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
38 or upgraded infrastructure; and

PAGE 4
4 HOUSE BILL 128

1 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
2 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
3 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and

4 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
5 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
6 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require
7 compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time
8 period; now, therefore,

8 emissions in the State based on the findings of the study conducted under subsection (a) of
9 this section.

10 (c) The report required under subsection (b) of this section shall include:

11 (1) a summary of the various cost–driving effects of covered greenhouse gas
12 emissions on the State, including effects on public health, natural resources, biodiversity,

20 that are projected to be incurred by the State and its residents to ~~mitigate~~ adapt to the

23 on to taxpayers as a result of requiring each fossil fuel company that has a sufficient nexus
24 to the State and emitted more than 1,000,000,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions globally
25 between 1995 and 2024 to compensate the State for climate change.
