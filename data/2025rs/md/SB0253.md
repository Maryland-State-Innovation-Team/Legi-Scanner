under § 7–239.1 of this subtitle were designed for warfare, specifically the destruction of
human beings, and for no legitimate civilian industrial use.

(b) The State recognizes the need to dispose of these chemical warfare materials
as safely as possible, ensuring the health and safety of State residents by the regulation of
their release into the environment.

(c) Since these chemical warfare materials are highly toxic or carcinogenic, in
addition to any other applicable requirements at law, the State shall require [without
exemption or waiver] that an applicant for the treatment by incineration of chemical

(2) In addition to any other applicable requirements, the Department may
not issue a permit for the construction, material alteration, or operation of a controlled
hazardous substance facility to be used for the treatment by incineration of a chemical
warfare material unless:

Department prior to issuance of a controlled hazardous substance facility permit:

(i) 1. That the proposed incinerator technology has consistently
met all applicable federal and State performance standards in an operational facility
comparable to the proposed facility for a period of time and under conditions acceptable to
the Department;

(ii) 2. That emissions and monitoring data from a comparable
facility demonstrate compliance with State toxic air pollutant standards established under
Title 2 of this article;

(iii) 3. That a destruction and removal efficiency of 99.9999
percent is achievable for each chemical warfare material to be incinerated at the facility;

(iv) 4. That the applicant has made adequate provision to
support and fund the development of a plan that demonstrates the capability of removing,
