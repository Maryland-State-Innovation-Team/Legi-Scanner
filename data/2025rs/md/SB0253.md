10 (a) The State of Maryland finds that the chemical warfare materials specified
11 under § 7–239.1 of this subtitle were designed for warfare, specifically the destruction of
12 human beings, and for no legitimate civilian industrial use.

13 (b) The State recognizes the need to dispose of these chemical warfare materials
14 as safely as possible, ensuring the health and safety of State residents by the regulation of
15 their release into the environment.

16 (c) Since these chemical warfare materials are highly toxic or carcinogenic, in
[without17 addition to any other applicable requirements at law, the State shall require
waiver]18 exemption or that an applicant for the treatment by incineration of chemical
[the]19 warfare materials shall comply with all requirements of this subtitleAPPLICABLE
20 and all regulations adopted under this subtitle.APPLICABLE
