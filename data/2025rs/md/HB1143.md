1 Preamble

2 WHEREAS, The death of Deamonte Driver, a 12–year–old insured under the
3 Maryland Medical Assistance Program, from a tooth abscess on February 25, 2007,
4 triggered a call to action in public health; and

5 WHEREAS, In response to Deamonte Driver’s death, the Maryland Department of
6 Health, oral health advocates, the dental provider community, and the health care
7 community collaborated to advance significant systemic improvements for access to dental
8 services for all children, including children in underserved communities in the State; and

9 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical
10 Assistance Program improved steadily between 2008 and 2015 with the percentage of
11 children receiving preventive services rising from 50.1% to 64%; and

12 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical
13 Assistance Program remained steady between 2016 and 2019, with 63% to 64% of children
14 receiving preventive services; and

15 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical
16 Assistance Program plummeted with the onset of the COVID–19 pandemic and has yet to
17 recover, with only 56.5% of children receiving preventive dental services in 2023; and

18 WHEREAS, The 2022–2023 Children’s Oral Health Survey conducted by the
19 Maryland Department of Health demonstrated that 21% of children had untreated dental
20 decay, with Hispanic children having the highest prevalence of untreated decay at 30% and
21 the Western region of the State with the highest prevalence at 27%; and

22 WHEREAS, The 2022–2023 Children’s Oral Health Survey conducted by the
23 Maryland Department of Health demonstrated that 51% of Maryland’s school children
24 needed sealants, with Black children at the highest prevalence of need at 60% and the
25 Western region of the State with the highest sealant need at 72%; and

26 WHEREAS, Children in the State need public health action to improve access to
27 dental services to avoid serious long–term health consequences; and

28 WHEREAS, School–based dental programs offer the potential to provide preventive
29 and screening services and linkages to permanent dental homes for children in every
30 Maryland community; now, therefore,
