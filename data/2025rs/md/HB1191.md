2 9–101.

3 (a) In any custody or visitation proceeding, if the court has reasonable grounds to
4 believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court
5 shall determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights
6 are granted to the party.

7 (b) Unless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child
8 abuse or neglect by the party, the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party,
9 except that the court may approve a supervised visitation arrangement that assures the
10 safety and the physiological, psychological, and emotional well–being of the child.

17 (3) any child residing within the party’s household, including a child other

19 (c) If the court finds that a party has committed abuse against the other parent

23 (2) the victim of the abuse.

24 9–101.2.

25 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, unless good cause for the

29 first degree or second degree murder of the other parent of the child, another child of the
