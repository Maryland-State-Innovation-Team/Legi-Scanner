19 ~~Preamble~~

20 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Cost~~ ~~sharing~~ ~~assistance~~ ~~is~~ ~~indispensable~~ ~~in~~ ~~helping~~ ~~many~~ ~~patients~~ ~~with~~
21 ~~rare,~~ ~~serious,~~ ~~and~~ ~~chronic~~ ~~diseases~~ ~~afford~~ ~~out–of–pocket~~ ~~costs~~ ~~for~~ ~~their~~ ~~essential~~ ~~and~~ ~~often~~
22 ~~life–saving~~ ~~medications;~~ ~~and~~

23 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Patients~~ ~~need~~ ~~cost~~ ~~sharing~~ ~~assistance~~ ~~because~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~high~~ ~~out–of–pocket~~
24 ~~costs~~ ~~for~~ ~~their~~ ~~prescription~~ ~~medications;~~ ~~and~~

25 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~When~~ ~~patients~~ ~~face~~ ~~unexpected~~ ~~charges~~ ~~during~~ ~~their~~ ~~health~~ ~~benefit~~ ~~plan~~
26 ~~year,~~ ~~they~~ ~~are~~ ~~less~~ ~~likely~~ ~~to~~ ~~adhere~~ ~~to~~ ~~their~~ ~~medication~~ ~~regimen;~~ ~~and~~

27 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Lack~~ ~~of~~ ~~patient~~ ~~adherence~~ ~~to~~ ~~needed~~ ~~medications~~ ~~leads~~ ~~to~~ ~~potential~~
28 ~~negative~~ ~~health~~ ~~consequences~~ ~~such~~ ~~as~~ ~~unnecessary~~ ~~emergency~~ ~~room~~ ~~visits,~~ ~~doctors’~~ ~~visits,~~
29 ~~surgeries,~~ ~~and~~ ~~other~~ ~~interventions;~~ ~~and~~

30 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Patients~~ ~~are~~ ~~able~~ ~~to~~ ~~use~~ ~~cost~~ ~~sharing~~ ~~assistance~~ ~~only~~ ~~after~~ ~~they~~ ~~have~~ ~~met~~
31 ~~requirements~~ ~~for~~ ~~coverage~~ ~~for~~ ~~their~~ ~~medication,~~ ~~including~~ ~~the~~ ~~medication’s~~ ~~inclusion~~ ~~on~~ ~~the~~
32 ~~patient’s~~ ~~formulary~~ ~~and~~ ~~utilization~~ ~~management~~ ~~protocols,~~ ~~such~~ ~~as~~ ~~prior~~ ~~authorization~~ ~~and~~
33 ~~step~~ ~~therapy;~~ ~~and~~

34 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Health~~ ~~insurers~~ ~~and~~ ~~pharmacy~~ ~~benefits~~ ~~managers~~ ~~have~~ ~~implemented~~
35 ~~programs,~~ ~~such~~ ~~as~~ ~~accumulator~~ ~~adjustment~~ ~~programs,~~ ~~to~~ ~~restrict~~ ~~cost~~ ~~sharing~~ ~~assistance~~
36 ~~from~~ ~~counting~~ ~~toward~~ ~~a~~ ~~patient’s~~ ~~deductible~~ ~~or~~ ~~annual~~ ~~out–of–pocket~~ ~~limit;~~ ~~and~~

37 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Because~~ ~~of~~ ~~accumulator~~ ~~adjustment~~ ~~programs,~~ ~~patients~~ ~~are~~ ~~required~~ ~~to~~
38 ~~continue~~ ~~to~~ ~~make~~ ~~payments~~ ~~even~~ ~~after~~ ~~they~~ ~~have~~ ~~reached~~ ~~their~~ ~~annual~~ ~~out–of–pocket~~ ~~limit,~~

4 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Patients~~ ~~often~~ ~~are~~ ~~not~~ ~~aware~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~inclusion~~ ~~of~~ ~~accumulator~~ ~~adjustment~~
5 ~~programs~~ ~~in~~ ~~their~~ ~~health~~ ~~plan~~ ~~contracts~~ ~~and~~ ~~tend~~ ~~to~~ ~~learn~~ ~~about~~ ~~these~~ ~~types~~ ~~of~~ ~~programs~~

7 ~~out,~~ ~~whether~~ ~~at~~ ~~the~~ ~~pharmacy,~~ ~~at~~ ~~the~~ ~~infusion~~ ~~center,~~ ~~or~~ ~~at~~ ~~home~~ ~~through~~ ~~the~~ ~~mail;~~ ~~and~~

8 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Accumulator~~ ~~adjustment~~ ~~programs~~ ~~allow~~ ~~health~~ ~~insurers~~ ~~and~~ ~~pharmacy~~
9 ~~benefits~~ ~~managers~~ ~~to~~ ~~“double~~ ~~dip”~~ ~~by~~ ~~accepting~~ ~~funds~~ ~~from~~ ~~both~~ ~~the~~ ~~cost~~ ~~sharing~~ ~~assistance~~
10 ~~program~~ ~~and~~ ~~the~~ ~~patient,~~ ~~beyond~~ ~~the~~ ~~original~~ ~~deductible~~ ~~amount~~ ~~and~~ ~~the~~ ~~annual~~
11 ~~out–of–pocket~~ ~~limit;~~ ~~and~~

12 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~It~~ ~~is~~ ~~a~~ ~~matter~~ ~~of~~ ~~public~~ ~~interest~~ ~~to~~ ~~require~~ ~~health~~ ~~insurers~~ ~~and~~ ~~pharmacy~~
13 ~~benefits~~ ~~managers~~ ~~to~~ ~~count~~ ~~any~~ ~~amount~~ ~~paid~~ ~~by~~ ~~the~~ ~~patient~~ ~~or~~ ~~on~~ ~~behalf~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~patient~~ ~~by~~
14 ~~another~~ ~~person~~ ~~toward~~ ~~the~~ ~~patient’s~~ ~~annual~~ ~~out–of–pocket~~ ~~limit~~ ~~and~~ ~~any~~ ~~cost~~ ~~sharing~~
