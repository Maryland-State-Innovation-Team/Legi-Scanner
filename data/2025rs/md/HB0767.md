Preamble

WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice ~~and~~ ~~an~~ ~~opportunity~~
~~to~~ ~~reclaim~~ ~~their~~ ~~personal~~ ~~belongings~~ ~~after~~ of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
~~and~~

~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Landlords~~ ~~should~~ ~~not~~ ~~be~~ ~~burdened~~ ~~with~~ ~~removing~~ ~~a~~ ~~tenant’s~~ ~~personal~~
~~belongings~~ ~~and~~ ~~placing~~ ~~them~~ ~~into~~ ~~public~~ ~~view~~ ~~immediately~~ ~~on~~ ~~eviction~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~tenant;~~ ~~and~~

~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Neighborhoods~~ ~~benefit~~ ~~from~~ ~~having~~ ~~a~~ ~~tenant’s~~ ~~personal~~ ~~belongings~~
~~safely~~ ~~stored~~ ~~rather~~ ~~than~~ ~~becoming~~ ~~a~~ ~~source~~ ~~of~~ ~~blight~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~community;~~ now, therefore,

SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
