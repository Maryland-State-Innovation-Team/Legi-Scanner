11 Preamble

12 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice ~~and~~ ~~an~~ ~~opportunity~~
13 ~~to~~ ~~reclaim~~ ~~their~~ ~~personal~~ ~~belongings~~ ~~after~~ of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
14 and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
15 ~~and~~

16 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Landlords~~ ~~should~~ ~~not~~ ~~be~~ ~~burdened~~ ~~with~~ ~~removing~~ ~~a~~ ~~tenant’s~~ ~~personal~~
17 ~~belongings~~ ~~and~~ ~~placing~~ ~~them~~ ~~into~~ ~~public~~ ~~view~~ ~~immediately~~ ~~on~~ ~~eviction~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~tenant;~~ ~~and~~

18 ~~WHEREAS,~~ ~~Neighborhoods~~ ~~benefit~~ ~~from~~ ~~having~~ ~~a~~ ~~tenant’s~~ ~~personal~~ ~~belongings~~
19 ~~safely~~ ~~stored~~ ~~rather~~ ~~than~~ ~~becoming~~ ~~a~~ ~~source~~ ~~of~~ ~~blight~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~community;~~ now, therefore,

19 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.

20 [(c)] (D) (1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall

22 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.

23 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
24 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
25 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
26 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.

27 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
