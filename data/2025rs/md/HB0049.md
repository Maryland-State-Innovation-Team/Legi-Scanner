SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:

(a) The Department of the Environment shall conduct an analysis of the potential
costs and benefits of building energy performance standards policy options featuring direct
emissions reduction requirements, energy use intensity requirements, and a combination of

(b) In conducting the analysis required under subsection (a) of this section, the
Department shall:

(1) identify policy considerations and recommendations, including
potential scenarios, including:

(i) a recommendation for calculating an alternative compliance fee
for energy use intensity on covered building owners based on a simple payback period that
takes into account any financial incentives offered to the building owners;

(ii) recommendations on how to address covered buildings that,
despite all available incentives including the avoidance of penalties and fees, would not
achieve compliance greenhouse gas emissions reductions and targets; and

(iii) recommendations on how to consider county–owned buildings,
community colleges, emergency facilities, manufacturing buildings, and residential
buildings, including considerations of tenants and condominium unit owners; and
