3 (Renewable Energy Certainty Act)

4 FOR the purpose of altering the factors the Public Service Commission must consider before
5 taking final action on a certificate of public convenience and necessity; establishing
6 a distributed generation certificate of public convenience and necessity to authorize
7 the construction and operation of a certain distributed solar energy generating
8 system; requiring the Power Plant Research Program, by a certain date, to develop
9 and submit to the Commission proposed siting and design requirements and
10 licensing conditions; establishing certain requirements for the construction of a
11 certain solar energy generating station or front–of–the–meter energy storage device;
12 prohibiting a local jurisdiction from adopting certain laws or regulations or denying
13 certain site development plans under certain circumstances; requiring a local
14 government to expedite the review and approval of certain site development plans
15 under certain circumstances; ~~authorizing~~ ~~a~~ ~~local~~ ~~government~~ ~~to~~ ~~establish~~ ~~a~~ ~~certain~~
16 ~~community~~ ~~solar~~ ~~energy~~ ~~generating~~ ~~system~~ ~~automatic~~ ~~enrollment~~ ~~program~~ ~~under~~
17 ~~certain~~ ~~circumstances;~~ establishing certain requirements for the sale, lease, and
18 installation of certain residential rooftop solar energy generating systems; requiring
19 the Maryland Department of Labor to develop a special solar contractor license;
20 requiring the Commission to conduct a certain study to establish a process by which
21 the Commission may establish certain ~~partnerships~~ procurement models; and
22 generally relating to generating stations.
