1 Annotated Code of Maryland
2 (2013 Volume and 2024 Supplement)

3 Preamble

4 WHEREAS, Local governments in Maryland must have authority from the
5 Maryland General Assembly in order to impose a development impact fee or an excise tax;
6 and

7 WHEREAS, Code home rule counties are authorized collectively to impose specified
8 development impact fees and excise taxes, and many counties have specific authorizations
9 from the Maryland General Assembly; and

10 WHEREAS, Title 20, Subtitle 7 of the Local Government Article provides for the
11 specific uses of revenues received from development impact fees; and

12 WHEREAS, County Commissioners of code counties may impose development
13 impact fees by public local law to finance any of the capital costs of additional or expanded
14 public works improvements, and facilities required to accommodate new construction or
15 development; and

16 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of the United States, in Sheetz v. County of El
17 Dorado, 601 U.S. ____ (2024), held that local government permit conditions (1) must have
18 an “essential nexus” to the government’s land use interests, and “rough proportionality” to
19 the development’s impact on the land use interest; and (2) may not require a landowner to
20 give up or pay more than is necessary to mitigate harms caused from new development;
21 now, therefore,
