4 (ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the
5 application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.

21 (iv) The presumption may not be rebutted solely on the basis of
22 evidence of the presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that

24 contributing.

30 A. the amount of child support that would have been required

27 paragraph (1) of this subsection shall constitute a material change of circumstance for the
28 purpose of a modification of a child support award.

30 a material change of circumstance for the purpose of a modification of a child support
