While human trafficking can profoundly impact the well-being and economic stability of individuals, including children, and may indirectly prevent or alleviate child poverty by rescuing child victims from exploitative situations, it does not directly address or provide services specifically designed to reduce child poverty.",2

The specific quantitative thresholds are a pragmatic, data-driven approach to dispute resolution.",2,"This bill aims to ease the installation of solar panels by limiting restrictions, which could potentially lead to lower energy costs for homeowners. While lower energy costs can indirectly benefit households, including those with children, the bill does not directly target child poverty or provide specific programs or financial aid to alleviate it.
